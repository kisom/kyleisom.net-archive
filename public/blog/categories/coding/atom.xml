    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the <a href="/blog/2012/01/23/basic-set-theory/">last post</a>, we took a look at the
basics of set theory. Now, I'd like to take a look at how to actually make use
of it in your code.</p>

<p>One of the issues with practically using the code in the last post is that the
initial subsets were defined arbitrarily and not derived from the superset. In
this post, all the examples are derived from the superset. We'll use a couple
techniques for doing this illustrate some of the various ways to do it.</p>

<p>In Python, we'll use an object-oriented approach, creating a few classes and
working on Book objects. In Clojure, we'll use records. Though we'll approach
language a little differently, I  hope they still bring clarity to the subject.</p>

<h2>Foundation: A Collection of Books</h2>

<p>The first thing we need to do in a useful system is determine what we mean by
book. The last post represented each book as a string denoting the title; while
that worked for a brief introduction, in practise it gives us very limited
options for building subsets. What we need to do is identify more information,
called attributes or fields, that give us the information we need to build our
subsets.</p>

<h3>Python</h3>

<p>In Python, we'll approach this using a class. I've saved them in <code>library.py</code>
in the <a href="/downloads/code/using-set-theory/py_example.tar.gz">Python example code</a></p>

<p>Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5b6c90></p>

<p>We'll also want a <code>BookCollection</code> class to store a set of books and provide
some utility methods for dealing with the collection:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5b6470>
These two classes are very short (and we'll extend them later to make them
more useful) but provide a solid foundation to begin building on. You'll want
to load the books in the class.</p>

<p>To load an example book, you would do use code similar to this:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5b5e30></p>

<p>Manually entering all these details is tedious. Fortunately for you, I put up
with the tedium to create a sample dataset in <code>sample_library.py</code>. You use the
function <code>get_library()</code> from the file to use it.</p>

<h3>Clojure</h3>

<p>In Clojure, we'll use a record to define a book:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5b5160></p>

<p>We're not using objects, so we don't need a record to store a collection.
(If we wanted to validate formats, we could do it using a Ref and a
:validator argument - that's left as an exercise for the reader). I have,
however, defined a few helper functions.</p>

<p>Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5b4378></p>

<p>Adding books is a simple affair:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5b3ab8></p>

<p>I've loaded a sample dataset into the <code>sample_library.clj</code> source file, available
from the <a href="/downloads/code/using-set-theory/clj-example.tar.gz">Clojure example code</a>.</p>

<h2>Building Subsets</h2>

<p>Now that we have a way to represent a book (with more useful information than
simply the title), we can start to build some subsets. Let's start by
looking at <em>set notation</em> (aka how to write a set both mathematically and
in code), and then continue on to recreate the two subsets in the previous
article, <code>epub</code> and <code>mobi</code>.</p>

<h3>Set Notation</h3>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_notation">set notation</a>, we denote
a set by writing:</p>

<blockquote><p>A = { x | x ∈ N, x &lt; 10 }</p></blockquote>

<p>which means the set of numbers that are members of (∈ means <em>'element of'</em>)
the set of positive integers and are less than 10. You might generalise this
as such:</p>

<blockquote><p>given the universal set S, which defines all the elements under
consideration, and some predicate P which is a function that returns either
true if the element satisfies the predicate (and thus should be included
in the set):<br>
{ x | x ∈ S, P(x) }</p></blockquote>

<p>We would express this set as:</p>

<blockquote><p>A = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }</p></blockquote>

<p>In Python, this is easily expressed with a
<a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0202/">list comprehension</a> (see also
the <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/expressions.html#list-displays">Python documentation</a>:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5bb420></p>

<p>And in Clojure, we could use something similar:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5baae8></p>

<h3>Building the Subsets</h3>

<p>As mentioned earlier, I have already built sample datasets for both Python
and Clojure, so be sure to use those and save yourself from having to build
your own just yet!</p>

<h4>Python</h4>

<p>In Python, we can use the built-in <code>filter</code> function to build a list. It will
serve as our predicate function.</p>

<p>Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5ba4f8></p>

<p>This gives me the output:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5b9da0></p>

<p>If you recall the definition of <code>BookCollection</code>, the filter method is
called as <code>filter(predicate, collection)</code>. In the case of the <code>mobi</code>
subset, it filters out anything that fails the test
<code>'mobi' in book.formats</code>. We might write this as</p>

<blockquote><p>{ book | book ∈ <code>my_library</code>, <code>is_mobi(book)</code> }</p></blockquote>

<p>in set notation. I've predefined some filters in the file <code>formats.py</code>
which is again in the <a href="/downloads/code/using-set-theory/py_example.tar.gz">example code</a>.</p>

<h4>Clojure</h4>

<p>Likewise, Clojure has a built-in filter function, in the form
<code>(filter pred coll)</code>. We'll use two
<a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/fn">anonymous functions</a>
to do our filtering:</p>

<p>Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5b8fb8></p>

<p>In the repl, this gives me:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5b82e8></p>

<p>I've put these filters in the <code>filters.clj</code> source file, along with definitions
for <code>epub-books</code> and <code>mobi-books</code>:</p>

<p>Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5bf368></p>

<h2>Parallels with SQL</h2>

<p>This introduction of filters might remind you of SQL, and for good reason.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd">Edgar Codd</a> designed SQL with
set theory in mind. You can think of tables as sets (provided, of course,
proper data preparation is done to ensure there are no duplicates in the
database), and operations like <code>SELECT</code> return subsets. For example, if we
were storing the books in a library, we would write something like</p>

<p>Liquid error: undefined method `join' for "\nSELECT * FROM books WHERE has_epub = TRUE;\n":String</p>

<h2>Moving On</h2>

<p>Now that we have a programmatic way to build subsets, we can automate the entire
set of sequences in the <a href="/blog/2012/01/23/basic-set-theory/">last post</a>:</p>

<h3>Python</h3>

<p>Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5be1c0></p>

<p>which gives me the results:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5bd540></p>

<h3>Clojure</h3>

<p>Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5bceb0></p>

<p>In the Clojure REPL, I get the following output:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5bc7f8></p>

<h2>Sets v. Lists</h2>

<p>Remember that one of the key attributes of a set is that each member is distinct.
Let's compare a set with a list; we'll do this with an intersection.</p>

<h3>Python</h3>

<p>Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5bc0a0></p>

<p>The result:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5bba38></p>

<h3>Clojure</h3>

<p>In Clojure, we'll use the vector type, which is like a list but the first
element isn't evaluated:</p>

<p>Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5c3058></p>

<p>Which yields:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5c28b0></p>

<h3>So what?</h3>

<p>You'll notice "Code Complete" shows up twice in the list. The advantage of sets
here is that only unique items are returned. A union is actually the list of
elements in both sets, <em>minus</em> the list of items that are in both
sets.</p>

<h3>A Second Stab: Python</h3>

<p>Implementing the set operations:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5c20b8></p>

<p>Applying this to our lists:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5c13c0></p>

<h3>A Second Stab: Clojure</h3>

<p>Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5c0088></p>

<p>Applying this:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5c7950></p>

<h2>Applications</h2>

<p>This has been just a quick introduction to the topic, but hopefully you
can see the relevance to areas like data mining. Coincidentally, datasets
tend to conform to the mathematical idea of sets, and typically with some
data massaging (i.e. to filter out duplicates), those that don't can
be made more like mathemtical sets. Once appropriately represented in the
computer, they can be acted upon with the basic set operations.</p>

<p>I've created an additional example: a web service providing a rest API to
the book collection. As with the code in this post, there is an example in
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/kisom/py_web_service/get/release-1.0.2.tar.gz">Python</a>
and in
<a href="https://github.com/kisom/clj_web_service/tarball/release-1.0.2">Clojure</a>. The
README in either example explains what dependencies are required. You can also
view the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/kisom/py_web_service/">Bitbucket repo</a> for the
Python example, or the <a href="https://github.com/kisom/clj_web_service">GitHub repo</a>
for the Clojure example.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.github.com/saolsen">Stephen Olsen</a> reviewed many iterations of this
article and helped me to properly articulate the important points (like illustrating
that unions require the subtraction of the intersection). I originally wrote
the bulk of this article on the 25th, but it took me until the 28th to finish
writing the API example code, until the 31st to add in the additional union
explanation, and until the 1st to polish it up.</p>

    <id>http://kisom.github.com/blog/2012/01/23/basic-set-theory</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I was explaining to someone the basics of set theory and how the
various basic operations translate to the real world. I used the example of the
project I'm currently working on, which is a web front end to my ebook library.
This is a very quick introduction aimed at people with a programming background
but who don't have a strong math background; the goal is to help you to learn
to use them without having to delve deep into the math behind them.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Basic Properties of Sets</h2>

<p>The first thing we have to do is to explain what is meant by a <em>set</em> -</p>

<blockquote><p>definition: set<br>
A set is any collection of items where each item is unique and the order of
items in the collection is not important.</p></blockquote>

<p>The uniqueness property is very important to sets: there are no duplicates in
a set.</p>

<p>So what does a set look like? In my database, I have a list of all the books
I have electronic copies of. Each book comes in at least one of three formats:
PDF, epub, or mobi. We'll call the <em>superset</em> (the universal set of all the items
under consideration) the list of all the books in the library. We'll call this
set 'L' (for Library). Part of the set might look like:</p>

<p>Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5c71f8></p>

<p>We use <code>'{}'</code> to denote the members of a set. The order of books in the library
doesn't matter here, and it doesn't make sense to have more than one entry for
a book in the library.</p>

<p>Building a set in Python is very easy:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5c68e8></p>

<p>Clojure has set notation built in using the <code>#{ }</code> syntax, and any collection
can be turned into a set with <code>(set coll)</code>:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5c5f10></p>

<p>So now we need to build some subsets.</p>

<blockquote><p>definition: subset<br>
A subset is some part of a set.</p>

<p>definition: proper subset<br>
A proper subset is some part of a set, but is not the whole set.</p></blockquote>

<p>For example, we'll create a subset of books P that are on or in Python. We'll also create a subset of books E that are in the English language. For my library,
because not all of my books are in or about Python, the number of members of P
is smaller than the number of elements in L. However, all of my books are in
English, so the number of elements in E is the same as the number of elements in
L. Therefore P is a proper subset, while E is not.</p>

<h2>The Basic Set Operations</h2>

<p>Now let's consider two proper subsets of the library to explain some of the basic
set operations: M is the subset of ebooks that I have in mobi format, and we'll
redefine E to be the list of ebooks in epub format. For the sake of the rest of
this article, let's note the following:</p>

<p>Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5c5538></p>

<p>In practical terms, this means in my library I have copies of:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Natural Language Processing with Python," "Introduction to Information
Retrieval," and "Code Complete" in mobi format</li>
<li>"The Joy of Clojure," "Mining the Social Web," and "Code Complete" in epub
format.</li>
</ul>


<p>In Python:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5c4818></p>

<p>In Clojure:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5c3f08></p>

<h3>Union</h3>

<p>A union is the set of members that appear in either set - if it's in at least
one of the sets, it will appear in a union of the two sets. So we could define
a subset of L that contains all the books I have in a mobile format, which for
our purposes means copies exist in epub or mobi format. In Python, you can
use the <code>set.union</code> method, and in Clojure you can use the functions in the
<code>clojure.set</code> namespace.</p>

<p>In Python:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5caab0></p>

<p>which yields the output:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5ca038></p>

<p>Remember that one of the properties of sets is that order is irrelevant, so you
might get the books in a different order (this applies to Clojure as well).</p>

<p>The same thing, in Clojure:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5c9228></p>

<p>You would see a similar output to the Python example.</p>

<p>Again, the practical result of this is a set of all the books I have in my
library in a mobile format.</p>

<h3>Intersection</h3>

<p>The intersection of two sets is a list of all the members that only appear in
both sets. In the library example, taking the intersection of the mobi and epub
sets gives me a set of my books that I have in both epub and mobi format. The
<code>intersection</code> function gives me this result.</p>

<p>The Python example:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5c8878></p>

<p>And in Clojure:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5c8170></p>

<p>For either example, the output should be just one book, given the sample sets:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for "\nCode Complete\n":String</p>

<p>I could use this result to know which books I can use on any mobile device.</p>

<h3>Difference</h3>

<p>The difference of one set from another is a list of all the members in the first
set that are not in the second set. This operation is a bit different from the
first two; the first two operations are
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property">commutative</a>,
but the result of a difference is dependent on the order of the sets. I'll
illustrate this with some code examples:</p>

<p>In Python:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5ced68></p>

<p>In Clojure:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5cdb20></p>

<p>As the output messages show, this gives us the set of books that are only
in mobi and the set of books that are only in epub. The output should look
something like:</p>

<p>Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5ccdb0></p>

<h3>Complements</h3>

<p>When discussing complements, we do so when considering a subset and it's
superset. The complement of a subset is the difference of subset from the
superset; i.e., the set of all members in the superset that are not in the
subset. For example, if I wanted to check my library for all ebooks I have
that are not in mobi format, I would use the superset <code>library</code> and take the
difference of mobi from library:</p>

<p>In Python:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5cc4c8></p>

<p>and in Clojure:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5cbac8></p>

<p>This gives us the output:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5d34a8></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This has been a very basic look at set theory and what it means in practise.
There is a lot more to set theory (see the references) but this should help
get you started. There are a lot of applications for set theory, such as in
data mining and natural language processing; it is a powerful tool that is
worth spending some time to get to know.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for the next post, which will be on how to use sets in your code.
We'll develop the library idea a bit more.</p>

    <updated>2011-12-03T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kisom.github.com/blog/2011/12/03/suddenly-enlightenment</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's been almost 28 hours since I last slept, so I apologise if this
post contains a few spelling or grammatical errors. As soon as I
become aware of them, rest assured I will quickly put them to right.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kyleisom.net/blog/2011/11/35-dot_emacs">Today's git commit</a> occurred
while I was working on getting a web development test VM / environment working. The
goal was to update a CGI script when I pushed to the dev vm. The commit log:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #<String:0x007ffd7a5e0ea0></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It took a while for me to grok what was happening with the hook, but finally it clicked.
I did a lot of reading online, and was greatly helped by the <a href="https://www.ora.com">O'Reilly</a>
book <a href="https://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596620137.do">Version Control with Git</a>
and the <code>githooks(5)</code> man page.</p>

<p>My remote repository was a bare git repo (one initialised with <code>git init --bare</code> that I
pushed my local changes to. I created a staging directory (<code>${HOME}/stage/cgitest</code>)
and created the following hook:</p>

<pre><code>kyle@www-dev:~/code/cgitest/hooks$ cat post-update
#!/bin/sh
export GIT_DIR=/home/kyle/code/zipcgi
export GIT_WORK_TREE=/home/kyle/stage/zipcgi
git reset --hard
git checkout -f
cp ${GIT_WORK_TREE}/zipcgi.py ~/bin/cgi/
</code></pre>

<p>As a side note, make sure the script is <code>chmod +x</code>'d.</p>

<p>The reason why we have to specify the git dir is that by default,
because this is in the bare repository, git will assume the git
directory is the repository directory. The problem is, that directory
doesn't have a working tree. A working tree is required to checkout
the repository - i.e. so we have a named file to work with. To work
around this, I explicitly specify a working tree . Then I copy the CGI
script to my CGI directory.</p>

<p>Why not just symlink the file? Well, symlinks work on inodes. This
allows multiple names to refer to the same file, but it does mean that
even though the file is in the same directory and shares the same
name, it is not guaranteed the same inode number. The git checkout
can, in essence, unlink the old file and create a completely new
file. The end result is that your symlink will likely be broken,
pointing to a now non-existent inode. The safest method is just to
copy the new version on top of the old one.</p>

<p>Why do we have to manipulate the environment variables
<code>GIT_DIR</code> (which points to the directory containing the actual git
repository, more on that in a second) and <code>GIT_WORK_TREE</code>, which
represents the working tree. To really understand this, you need to
understand the difference between the working tree and the
repository. You could take the long route and read the excellent book
I mentioned above and wade through man pages (which are pretty well
written, but there is a lot of information to keep track of). An
alternative is to buckle in and keep reading for my crash course.</p>

<p>Still here? Buckled in? Let's do this. A git repository is basically a
filesystem-based database that uses hashes for identification and
great success. If you poke around in your git repository (which in a
standard local repository is in <code>${PROJECT}/.git</code>), particularly under
objects, you will see what I mean. Everything is stored as a hash
object. Git uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA-1</a>, and
under <code>.git/objects</code> you will see a list of subdirectorys. These
subdirectories (with the exception of <code>pack</code> and <code>info</code>) named after
the first byte of the SHA-1 hash (which is two bytes when stored as a
semi-human readable hex digest). Under these subdirectories, git
stores the objects as the remaining 19 bytes (again, 38 bytes when
stored as a hex digest) of the hash. The file is
zlib-compressed. Don't believe me? If you clone my
<a href="https://github.com/kisom/woofs">woofs project</a> and look up</p>

<p><code>.git/objects/bf/2f7383ca7343f85f1308fc6dc3c34dbd047d90</code>.</p>

<p>Try the following python code:</p>

<pre><code>import zlib
print zlib.decompress(open('2f7383ca7343f85f1308fc6dc3c34dbd047d90').read())
</code></pre>

<p>You should see a working version of the script (and the latest version
as of this writing). This is how git sees everything. (If you want to
see what git sees a file as, use <code>git hash-object &lt;FILE&gt;</code>.)</p>

<p>The working directory is where you, the developer or end user,
interact with the contents of the database. This is where things can
be staged to be committed, and in a bare repo (typically found
on remote repos), there won't be a working directory because you
aren't working directly on that copy of the repo. Try this:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir -p ~/tmp/stage/woofs_working
export GIT_DIR=~/Code/woofs/.git 
export GIT_WORK_TREE=~/tmp/stage/woofs_working
cd ~
git reset --hard
ls ~/tmp/stage/woofs_working
</code></pre>

<p>Voilà! You should see the contents of the repo there. (I'd recommend
either closing out that terminal session or running</p>

<pre><code>unset GIT_DIR GIT_WORK_TREE
</code></pre>

<p>to prevent problems later on. Also, while I'm using a repo I chose at
random from my <code>~/Code</code> directory, you could (and should) be trying
with a repo of your own.</p>

<p>It should be clear now why I had to explicitly specify the two. The
next two commands just reset the working directory to the lastest
commit (i.e. the one that was just pushed) and check out a fresh copy,
to make sure everything that should be present is present.</p>

<p>This turned out to be a longer post than I had expected, but my hope
is that it helps other people quickly get their hooks operational. The
cool thing about hooks is they are just executable shells scripts,
which means:</p>

<ol>
<li>the script's <code>${PWD}</code> is the hooks directory in the git repo.</li>
<li>the <code>${GIT_DIR}</code> is by default '.' and is the repo directory. for
example, if we had a bare woofs repo, it would be something like
<code>/home/kyle/code/woofs</code>, while in a local repo it would be
<code>/home/kyle/code/woofs/.git</code>.</li>
<li>because it's just a shell script, you can use any language you can
use a shebang for.</li>
</ol>


<p>Git hooks are a powerful tool and can greatly boost your productivity,
automatically deploy code, and help us fight SkyNet. You should
consider using them in your next project.</p>

<p>I've started using emacs, which is an act of such great blasphemy for
a red-blooded stalwart vim-wielding hacker such as myself that I find
it difficult to come to grips with sometimes. But there is a method to
my madness, and it isn't just that my morals are so comprised right
now in this nadir of my life that I've even started learning
javascript (a running joke).</p>

<p>Due to my current work situation, and the prospect of traveling to and
spending several months in a region with little to no network
connectivity, I've purchased a new 11" Macbook Air. I chose the 11"
model solely for price reasons; I would much prefer a larger
laptop. I've previously owned two EeePCs (the 7"
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASUS_Eee_PC#Eee_700_series">Eee PC 701</a>
and the 11"
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASUS_Eee_PC#Specifications">Eee PC 1101HAB</a>),
so I'm familiar with the smaller form-factor, and not a huge fan to be
honest.</p>

<p>Enter emacs - I can do all my work on emacs, with an integrated python
development environment incorporating a shell, pdb (with a pane that
shows the current line of the file being executed as you're stepping
through code). I'll still have the OS X desktop,
<a href="http://www.iterm2.com/">iterm2</a>,
<a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">tmux</a>, and
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/">macvim</a>. But for getting things
done, I think that emacs is going to help out a lot.</p>

<p>Plus it's backed by a Lisp flavour.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>UPDATE: originally this post was only about doing this in git. Since I use
mercurial almost as much as I use git, I decided to look into how to do it
with mercurial too.</p>

<p>I recently was explaining to someone that as a coder, I do (or should do)
a lot more than just code. I figured since I hadn't written anything here in
a while, I'd put my thoughts down here.</p>

<p>i found myself needing to generate a patchfile today from a git repo. it turns
out to be a very easy task.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>first, commit to a clean working directory. i'll asume you are on the
'master' (git) or 'tip' (hg) branch, but s/master/$branch/ as appropriate.</p></li>
<li><p>if you have only one commit between you and the commit you need to diff
against:
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for "\ngit format-patch master^ --stdout > my.patch`\n":String
or
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for "\nhg export tip > my.patch  <br/>\n":String</p></li>
<li><p>otherwise, substitute in the appropriate commit</p></li>
<li><p>to apply the patch, it's
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for "\ngit apply --stat my.patch\n":String
or
Liquid error: undefined method `join' for "\nhg patch my.patch\n":String</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I did say it was a very easy task... You'll notice mercurial makes this easier
(or at least I think so) than git.</p>
