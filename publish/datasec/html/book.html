<h1 id="introduction"><span>Chapter  </span> Introduction</h1>

<p>This is a book about how to use data security practically. It’s written
assuming that you are a coder who’s already writing cool and audacious
projects, but you don’t have a background in writing secure systems. I also
assume that you have a passing familiarity with UNIX-based operating
systems; while I don’t expect you to be a UNIX wizard, I also expect you to
not be terribly daunted when tinkering about the command line. I try not to
get in your way and merely to facilitate a discussion in most cases about
ways we as coders can write better applications for our users.</p>

<p>The news headlines are full of stories about popular online services being
com-promised. It’s becoming something that we are more used to living
with. I think that we can do better. My particular interest in this problem
started with two events that coincided: the first involved writing software
for work to build encrypted updates for a project I was working on. I was
doing this in Python, and so became fairly familiar with the 
<a href="https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/">PyCrypto library</a>. 
At the same time, a friend of mine was working on writing
authentication code, also in Python. He was trying to use the PyCrypto
library as well, but really didn’t understand how cryptography worked and
how to apply it in this case. That inspired me to write a ten page
introduction to cryptography (also illustrated with Python). I’ve been
mulling over the idea of expanding that into a book on data security, and
now the time has come to write it.</p>

<p>From my perspective, a lot of the problem stems from a fundamental
misunderstanding of what security is, and how to integrate it. I will try to
address that issue here, and hopefully help other developers to understand
not only why it’s important, but to see that it’s not just snake oil to be
thrown into the mix so that it "just works."</p>

<p>The book is subtitled Illustrated With Python, which I am slightly worried
will discourage those not familiar with the Python language. I chose to use
Python because it is both a language I am well familiar with, and because it
is a very readable language. Readers should note that the emphasis in the
book is not on the Python way to do things; readers who are familiar with
Python will note that I shy away from idiomatic Python that will be
difficult for those unfamiliar with the language to understand.</p>

<h1 id="introduction-to-data-security"><span>Chapter 0 </span> Introduction to Data Security</h1>

<p>Data security is one of those things you hear a lot about, but most of us
are busy getting things done; unfortunately for our users, data security
tends to be put on the back-burner, if we remember it at all. Data security
doesn't have to be a burden on the developer, and most importantly, it's in
the best interest of users. One principle I particularly like for software
engineering is the Principle of Least Astonishment.</p>

<p><strong><em>THE PRINCIPLE OF LEAST ASTONISHMENT:</em></strong><br>
<em>A program's behaviour should not surprise the end user.</em></p>

<p>How does this relate to data security? A user never expects their data to be
leaked out of the application or their information to be shared with people
they dont intend for it to. This might be an explicit understanding or an
implicit one, especially when users don't really understand the problem
domain. If your users are from a wide range of backgrounds, they may not
have a solid understanding of the basics of how to keep their information
safe. In fact, they may not even realise what they don't know. So, it
becomes even more important for developers to ensure that, as much as
possible, their data is safe. What I will discuss in this book are ways to
do that, while keeping in mind the misconception (not always true) that the
more secure a system is, the less accessible it is. I'd like to address that
misconception, and help you to make your applications as transparently
secure as possible.</p>

<p>The first thing we'll take a look at are some of the objectives of
information security that are most generally applicable to software,
i.e. those that we can address. Then we'll take a high-level walk through
some basic UNIX security that's applicable (and perhaps on the Windows
platform as well). Even if your application is a web application, it's
probably running on a UNIX machine of some sort, and that represents an area
that you should pay attention to as well. If you're a Windows developer,
there will still be some information applicable, but you can probably skim
through this part. Then we'll take a high level look at cryptography; I've
chosen to stay away from deep mathematical discussions and only discuss
those aspects you need to understand as a coder to effectively make use of
it. Following that, we'll see a few scenarios where your code is
vulnerable. The rest of this chapter will be a gentle introduction to each
of those areas, and the rest of the book will flesh it out with code
examples.
<br>
There are four information security principles you should keep in mind when
writing software:</p>

<ol>
<li>Privacy </li>
<li>Anonymity </li>
<li>Repudiation </li>
<li>Integrity</li>
</ol>

<p>Let's take a look at these in a little more depth, and see how they apply to the software we're writing.</p>

<p>First, we visit the concepts of <strong>authentication</strong> and <strong>authorisation</strong>.
Authentication is confirming the identity of a user--most often by way of a
username (the user's identity) and password (the secret used to
authenticate). Other ways of authentication include using smart cards, where
the identity is given by the cryptographic key on the card and the
authentication is done by entering a PIN to unlock the key, or perhaps using
something like a one-time password token tied to an OpenID. Once the user's
identity has been confirmed (the user is now <strong>authenticated</strong>), their
access to resources is controlled by <strong>authorisation</strong>. Authorisation is the
check to see "is this user allowed to do this?" If we look at this from the
perspective of a user's ability to access files on a computer, they are
typically authenticated by their login and password (or, on some laptops,
via a login and fingerprint). When a user tries to read or write to a file,
the system checks the access control list (an authorisation scheme) to see
if the user is authorised to do this. Let's look at the Twitter application
on a mobile as another example: when you try to use the app, you have to
sign into twitter and authorise access on Twitter's website for the
application. Your username and password authenticate you to Twitter, and
then you choose to authorise the application's access to the site.
Authentication and authorisation may be done by other means as well for
entities other than users. We'll call any entity a user in this book, but
that user might be a person, a computer, or something else entirely. With
that dead horse beaten, we can move on.</p>

<p>The principle of <strong>privacy</strong> states that information may only be viewed by
those authorised to view it. In terms of UNIX files, a user might be able to
log into a computer, but does not have access to read another user's files.
On twitter, you can protect your timeline, so that only your friends can
read your tweet. It's not unreasonable for a user to expect they can control
who else has access to their resources; obviously a user with a public blog
expects anyone to be able to read their posts, but they may not expect just
anyone to see other details about that user. When you're designing an
application, it helps to think about which pieces of information a user
should have control over. Some applications will require fine-grained
control--say it's designed so user A can choose to share one post only with
group B and another post only with group C. Others will be
course-grained--users in group B will always have access to posts by user A.</p>

<p><strong>Anonymity</strong> is a hot topic these days with the so-called "nym wars" on
Google+ as but one example. This boils down to the idea that, depending on
your stance, a user should be able to separate their different identities
from each other. In the Google+ debate, it's the idea that users want to be
able to separate their real-world identity from their electronic identity.
That is, my identity on Google+ may not be the same identity I want to use
on my blog. This brings out another point about security: most security
engineering isn't just a technical question; it's a social question. Many of
our applications aren't just technical applications, but have social value
as well; many security decisions are made by weighing social considerations.
Your decision in regards to anonymity is going to be a social decision, but
it should be decided while designing the application. Bolt-on security
(added after the design phase) may be somewhat effective, but it tends to
cause a lot of problems.</p>

<p><strong>Repudiation</strong> is a fancy word that means the ability to deny ownership of
information. You'll hear this term a lot in discussions about cryptography,
particularly with digital signatures. If a user's data is <strong>repudiable</strong>,
the user can plausibly deny owning that data (for example, user A might want
to be able to deny having posted something unpopular about a sensitive
topic). Conversely, if a user's information is <strong>non-repudiable</strong>, she
cannot plausibly deny owning that information. I'll have more to say on this
in a bit, but for now you know what I'm talking about when I bandy about the
term like "non-repudiable."</p>

<p>Users also want some degree of assurance that their data won't be changed or
tampered with. This is the principle of <strong>data integrity</strong>--information may
only be changed by people authorised to do so. This isn't just a security
issue; natural disasters and junior sysadmins (some would say naming both is
a redundancy) have a clever way of accidentally modifying your data without
the user's authorisation. Of course, we expect (and probably constantly
tell) users to backup their data, but your application may not be easily
backed up by the user. There's also a case to be made for <strong>transparency</strong>
in both showing users what data you have of theirs on your systems or in
your application and allowing them to download or backup that information
easily. Even data like photos, which are easy to back up, may come from a
disparate number of sources, should be considered. For example, a user might
upload photos from his phone, his laptop, and his tablet. All these
different sources may make backing up more difficult, although far from
impossible, and having one place to back them all up from may be useful.</p>

<p>These basic principles are all properties to consider when designing your
system; they fit alongside all the other software engineering principles
like modularity that should be considered. It is far easier to design these
in at the start than to try to bolt them on later.</p>

<p>Another thing to think about is the use case for your software; namely, you
might not be able to think of all the ways users will use the system. Of
course, we'd like to think of our users as living in an ideal world where
using real names isn't an issue and no one has anything to hide, but this is
not the world we live in. You should also consider some of the challenges
faced by users living in non-ideal places. If you're allowing people to
upload data or users must download information to synchronise, consider that
many users don't have high-speed internet or a large bandwidth cap. In many
countries, power is at a premium, and users shut down their computers when
they aren't using them out of economic necessity, instead of being able to
leave them on. Users might also be living in restrictive regions where
posting information critical of other people might be dangerous for them. If
you have any desire for your software to have a global impact, you should
consider them. If your application isn't region-specific, you should most
certainly keep this in mind when designing your software.</p>

<p>There are a couple areas you can start to actually design security into your
code. First, there are the fundamental security mechanisms available on the
platform you are coding on. There are coding errors that can lead to flaws,
such as the well-known SQL injections and buffer overflows that are some of
the mainstays of many successful attacks. There are mechanisms to secure
data in transit (when the data is being accessed and used) and at rest (when
the data is not being used). As coding errors have been dealt with quite
effectively in many other books (see the bibliography for more), we'll focus
on the fundamental security mechanisms and other data security mechanisms,
and in particular, how we can use basic UNIX security mechanisms and
cryptography effectively. We'll also consider some real world ways in which
failing to secure your code can lead to an exploit.</p>

<h1 id="practical-introduction-to-cryptography"><span>Chapter 1 </span> Practical Introduction to Cryptography</h1>

<h2 id="introduction-3">1.1 Introduction</h2>

<p>This chapter is adapter from my introductory article to cryptography. We'll take
a quick, high-level overview of cryptography. The 
<a href="https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/">PyCrypto</a> and
<a href="http://www.mindrot.org/projects/py-bcrypt/">py-bcrypt</a> libraries will be used
to illustrate some general things to know when writing cryptographic code. 
We'll take a look at symmetric, public-key, hybrid, cryptographic hashing, 
password hashing, and message authentication codes.</p>

<p>Some quick terminology: for those unfamiliar, it's important to know what these 
mean:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>plaintext</strong>: the original message</li>
<li><strong>ciphertext</strong>: the message after cryptographic transformations are applied 
to obscure the original message.</li>
<li><strong>encrypt</strong>: producing ciphertext by applying cryptographic transformations
to plaintext.</li>
<li><strong>decrypt</strong>: producing plaintext by applying cryptographic transformations to
ciphertext.</li>
<li><strong>cipher</strong>: a particular set of cryptographic transformations providing means
of both encryption and decryption.    </li>
<li><strong>ciphersystem</strong>: a set of cryptographic transformations that take a large input and
transform it to a unique (typically fixed-size) output. For hashes to be
cryptographically secure, collisions should be practically nonexistent. It
should be practically impossible to determine the input from the output.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cryptography is an often misunderstood component of information security. We 
covered some information security principles in the previous chapter; the 
ones that cryptography covers are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>privacy</strong> (aka <strong>confidentiality</strong>).    </li>
<li><strong>data integrity</strong>: the plaintext message arrives unaltered.     </li>
<li><strong>entity authentication</strong>: the identity of the sender is verified. An entity
may be a person or a machine.   </li>
<li><strong>message authentication</strong>: the message is verified as having been 
unaltered.     </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that cryptography is used to obscure the contents of a message and verify
its contents and source. It will <strong>not</strong> hide the fact that two entities are 
communicating.</p>

<p>There are two basic types of ciphers: symmetric and public-key ciphers. A 
symmetric key cipher employs the use of shared secret keys. They also tend to
be much faster than public-key ciphers. A public-key cipher is so-called because
each key consists of a private key which is used to generate a public key. Like
their names imply, the private key is kept secret while the public key is 
passed around. First, I'll take a look at a specific type of symmetric ciphers:
block ciphers.</p>

<h2 id="block-ciphers">1.2 Block Ciphers</h2>

<p>There are two further types of symmetric keys: stream and block ciphers. Stream
ciphers operate on data streams, i.e. one byte at a time. Block ciphers operate
on blocks of data, typically 16 bytes at a time. The most common block cipher
and the standard one you should use unless you have a very good reason to use
another one is the AES block cipher, documented in 
<a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf">FIPS PUB 197</a>.
AES is a specific subset of the Rijndael cipher. AES uses block size of 
128-bits (16 bytes); data should be padded out to fit the block size - the
length of the data block must be multiple of the block size. For example, 
given an input of <code>ABCDABCDABCDABCD ABCDABCDABCDABCD</code> no padding would
need to be done. However, given <code>ABCDABCDABCDABCD ABCDABCDABCD</code> an 
additional 4 bytes of padding would need to be added. A common padding scheme 
is to use <code>0x80</code> as the first byte of padding, with <code>{0x00</code> bytes 
filling out the rest of the padding. With padding, the previous example would 
look like: <code>ABCDABCDABCDABCD ABCDABCDABCD\x80\x00\x00\x00</code>.</p>

<p>Writing a padding function is pretty easy:<br />
```
def pad_data(data):
    # return data if no padding is required
    if len(data) % 16 == 0: 
        return data</p>

<pre><code># subtract one byte that should be the 0x80
# if 0 bytes of padding are required, it means only
# a single \x80 is required.

padding_required     = 15 - (len(data) % 16)

data = '%s\x80' % data
data = '%s%s' % (data, '\x00' * padding_required)

return data
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Similarly, removing padding is also easy:
```
def unpad_data(data):
    if not data: 
        return data</p>

<pre><code>data = data.rstrip('\x00')
    if data[-1] == '\x80':
        return data[:-1]
    else:
        return data
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>I've included these functions in the 
<a href="http://www.kyleisom.net/publish/datasec/code/chapter1.tar.gz">example code</a>

<p>Encryption with a block cipher requires selecting a 
<a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/index.html">block mode</a>.
By far the most common mode used is <strong>cipher block chaining</strong> or 
<em>CBC</em> mode. Other modes include <strong>counter (CTR)</strong>, 
<strong>cipher feedback (CFB)</strong>, and the extremely insecure
<strong>electronic codebook (ECB)</strong>. CBC mode is the standard and is 
well-vetted, so I will stick to that in this tutorial. Cipher block chaining 
works by XORing the previous block of ciphertext with the current block. You 
might recognise that the first block has nothing to be XOR'd with; enter the 
<em><a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/nonce.pdf">initialisation vector</a></em>. 
This comprises a number of randomly-generated bytes of data the same
size as the cipher's block size. This initialisation vector should random 
enough that it cannot be recovered; one manner of doing this is to combine a
standard UNIX timestamp with a block-size group of random data, using a standard
hashing algorithm such as MD5 to make it unique.</p>

<p>One of the most critical components to encryption is properly generating 
random data. Fortunately, most of this is handled by the PyCrypto library's
<code>Crypto.Random.OSRNG module</code>. You should know that the more entropy sources
available (such as network traffic and disk activity), the faster the system
can generate cryptographically-secure random data. I've written a function that 
can generate a <em>cryptographic nonce</em> (an number used only once)
suitable for use as an initialisation vector. This will work on a UNIX machine; 
the comments note how easy it is to adapt it to a Windows machine. This 
function requires a version of PyCrypto at least 2.1.0 or higher.
```
import time
import Crypto.Random.OSRNG.posix</p>

<p>def generate_nonce():
    rnd = Crypto.Random.OSRNG.posix.new().read(BLOCK_SIZE)
    rnd = '%s%s' % (rnd, str(time.time()))
    nonce = Crypto.Hash.MD5.new(data = rnd)</p>

<pre><code>return nonce.digest()
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>I will note here that the python <code>random</code> module is completely unsuitable for
cryptography (as it is completely deterministic). You shouldn't use it for
cryptographic code. If you're using another language, you need to be careful
to select a cryptographically-secure random number generator (RNG).</p>

<p>Symmetric ciphers are so-named because the key is shared across any entities.
There are three key sizes for AES: 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit, aka 16-byte,
24-byte, and 32-byte key sizes. If you want to use a passphrase, you 
should use a digest algorithm that produces an appropriately sized digest, and
hash that passphrase. For example, for AES-256, you would want to use SHA-256.
Here is a sample function to generate an AES-256 key from a passphrase:
```
# generate an AES-256 key from a passphrase
def passphrase(password, readable = False):
    """
    Converts a passphrase to a format suitable for use as an AES key.</p>

<pre><code>If readable is set to True, the key is output as a hex digest. This is
suitable for sharing with users or printing to screen when debugging
code.

By default readable is set to False, in which case the value it 
returns is suitable for use directly as an AES-256 key.
"""
key     = Crypto.Hash.SHA256.new(password)

if readable:
    return key.hexdigest()
else:
    return key.digest()
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>We could include this a set of AES encryption and decryption functions:
```
mode = Crypto.Cipher.AES.MODE_CBC       # shortcut to clean up code</p>

<p># AES-256 encryption using a passphrase
def passphrase_encrypt(password, iv, data):
    key     = passphrase(password)
    data    = pad_data(data)
    aes     = Crypto.Cipher.AES.new(key, mode, iv)</p>

<pre><code>return aes.encrypt(data)
</code></pre>

<p># AES-256 decryption using a passphrase
def passphrase_decrypt(password, iv, data):
    key     = passphrase(password)
    aes     = Crypto.Cipher.AES.new(key, mode, iv)
    data    = aes.decrypt(data)</p>

<pre><code>return unpad_data(data)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Notice how the data is padded before being encrypted and unpadded after 
decryption - the decryption process will not remove the padding on its own.</p>

<p>Unless you are you doing interactive encryption passphrase encryption won't be
terribly useful. Instead, we just need to generate 32 random bytes (and make
sure we keep track of it) and use that as the key:
<code># generate a random AES-256 key
def generate_aes_key():
    rnd     = Crypto.Random.OSRNG.posix.new().read(KEY_SIZE)
    return rnd</code></p>

<p>We can use this key directly in the AES transformations:
```
def encrypt(key, iv, data):
    aes     = Crypto.Cipher.AES.new(key, mode, iv)
    data    = pad_data(data)</p>

<pre><code>return aes.encrypt(data)
</code></pre>

<p>def decrypt(key, iv, data):
    aes     = Crypto.Cipher.AES.new(key, mode, iv)
    data    = aes.decrypt(data)</p>

<pre><code>return unpad_data(data)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>That should cover the basics of block cipher encryption. We've gone over key
generation, padding, and encryption / decryption. AES-256 isn't the only 
block cipher provided by the PyCrypto package, but again: it is the standard
and well vetted.</p>

<h2 id="ascii-armouring">1.3 ASCII-Armouring</h2>

<p>I'm going to take a quick detour and talk about ASCII armouring. If you've 
played with the crypto functions above, you'll notice they produce an annoying
dump of binary data that can be a hassle to deal with. One common technique for
making the data a little bit easier to deal with is to encode it with 
base64 (which is defined in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1521.html">RFC 1521</a>. 
There are a few ways to incorporate this into python:</p>

<h3 id="absolute-base64-encoding">1.3.1 Absolute Base64 Encoding</h3>

<p>The easiest way is to just base64 encode everything in the encrypt function. 
Everything that goes into the decrypt function should be in base64 - if it's 
not, the <code>base64</code> module will throw an error: you could catch this and 
then try to decode it as binary data.</p>

<h3 id="a-simple-header">1.3.2 A Simple Header</h3>

<p>A slightly more complex option, and the one I adopt in this article, is to use 
a <code>x00</code> as the first byte of the ciphertext for binary data, and to use 
<code>\x41</code> (an ASCII "<code>A</code>'') for ASCII encoded data. This will increase 
the complexity of the encryption and decryption functions slightly. We'll also 
pack the initialisation vector at the beginning of the file as well. Given now 
that the <code>iv</code> argument might be <code>None</code> in the decrypt function, I 
will have to rearrange the arguments a bit; for consistency, I will move it in 
both functions. I leave adding it into the <code>passphrase_encrypt</code> and 
<code>passphrase_decrypt</code> functions as an exercise for the reader. My modified 
functions look like this now:
```
def encrypt(key, data, iv, armour = False):
    aes     = Crypto.Cipher.AES.new(key, mode, iv)
    data    = pad_data(data)
    ct      = aes.encrypt(data)         # ciphertext
    ct      = iv + ct                   # pack the initialisation vector in</p>

<pre><code># ascii-armouring
if armour:
    ct = '\x41' + base64.encodestring(ct)
else:
    ct = '\x00' + ct

return ct
</code></pre>

<p>def decrypt(key, data, iv = None):
    # remove ascii-armouring if present
    if data[0] == '\x00':
        data = data[1:]
    elif data[0] == '\x41':
        data = base64.decodestring(data[1:])</p>

<pre><code>iv      = data[:16]
data    = data[16:]
aes     = Crypto.Cipher.AES.new(key, mode, iv)
data    = aes.decrypt(data)
return unpad_data(data)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h3 id="a-more-complex-container">1.3.3 A More Complex Container</h3>

<p>There are more complex ways to do it (and you'll see it with the public keys 
in the next section) that involve putting the base64 into a container of sorts
that contains additional information about the key.</p>

<h2 id="public-key-cryptography">1.4 Public Key Cryptography</h2>

<p>Now it is time to take a look at public-key cryptography. Public-key 
cryptography, or PKC, involves the use of two-part keys. The private key is
the sensitive key that should be kept private by the owning entity, whereas the
public key (which is generated from the private key) is meant to be distributed
to any entities which must communicate securely with the entity owning the 
private key. Confusing? Let's look at this using the venerable Alice and Bob,
patron saints of cryptography.</p>

<p>Alice wants to talk to Bob, but doesn't want Eve to know the contents of the
message. Both Alice and Bob generate a set of private keys. From those private
keys, they both generate public keys. Let's say they post their public keys on
their websites. Alice wants to send a private message to Bob, so she looks up
Bob's public key from his site. (In fact, there is a way to distribute keys via
a central site or entity; this is called a public key infrastructure (PKI). The 
public key can be used as the key to encrypt a message with PKC. The resulting 
ciphertext can only be decrypted using Bob's private key. Alice sends Bob the 
resulting ciphertext, which Eve cannot decrypt without Bob's private key. 
Hopefully this is a little less confusing.</p>

<p>One of the most common PKC systems is RSA (which is an acronym for the last 
names of the designers of the algorithm). Generally, RSA keys are 1024-bit,
2048-bit, or 4096-bits long. The keys are most often in 
PEM (defined in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1421">RFCs 1421-1424</a>)
or 
<a href="http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/languages/X.690-0207.pdf">DER</a>
format. Generating RSA keys with PyCrypto is extremely easy:
```
def generate_key(size):
    PRNG    = Crypto.Random.OSRNG.posix.new().read
    key     = Crypto.PublicKey.RSA.generate(size, PRNG)</p>

<pre><code>return key
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The <code>key</code> that is returned isn't like the keys we used with the block ciphers:
it is an RSA object and comes with several useful built-in methods. One of 
these is the <code>size()</code> method, which returns the size of the key in bits minus
one. For example:
```</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>import publickey
      key = publickey.generate_key( 1024 )
      key.size()
      1023</p>
      
      <p>```</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>A quick note: I will use 1024-bit keys in this tutorial because they are 
faster to generate, but in practice you should be using at least 2048-bit 
keys. The key also includes encryption and decryption methods in the class:
```</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>import publickey
      import base64
      message = 'Test message...'
      ciphertext = key.encrypt(message, None)
      print base64.encodestring(ciphertext[0])
      gzA9gXfHqnkValdhhYjRVVSxuygx48i66h0vFUnmVu8FZXJtmaACvNDo43D0vjjHzFiblE1eCFiI
      xlhVuHxldWXJSnARgWX1bTY7imR9Hve+WQC8rl+qB5xpq3xnKH7/z8/5YdLvCo/knXYE1cI/XYJP
      EP1nA6bUZNj6bD1Zx4w=
      ```</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>None</code> that is passed into the encryption function is part of the 
PyCrypto API for those publickey ciphers requiring an additional random number 
function to be passed in. It returns a tuple containing only the encrypted 
message. In order to pass this to the decryption function, we need to pass only 
the encrypted message as a string:
```</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>ciphertext = key.encrypt(message, None)[0]
      key.decrypt(ciphertext)
      'Test message...'
      ```</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>While these are simple enough, we could put them into a pair of functions that
also include ASCII-armouring:
```
def encrypt(key, message, armour = True):
    ciphertext  = key.encrypt( message, None )
    ciphertext  = ciphertext[0]</p>

<pre><code>if armour:
    ciphertext = '\x41' + base64.encodestring( ciphertext )
else:
    ciphertext = '\x00' + base64.encodestring( ciphertext )

return ciphertext
</code></pre>

<p>def decrypt(key, message):
    if   '\x00' == message[0]:
        message = message[1:]
    elif '\x41' == message[0]:
        message == base64.decodestring( message[1:] )</p>

<pre><code>plaintext   = key.decrypt( message )
    return plaintext
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>These two functions present a common API that will simplify encryption and
decryption and make it a little easier to read. Assuming we still have the same
<code>message</code> definition as before:
```</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>ciphertext = publickey.encrypt(key, message)
      publickey.decrypt(key, ciphertext)
          'Test message...'
      ```</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, what if we want to export this generated key and read it in later? The key
comes with the method <code>exportKey()</code>. If the key is a private key, it will
export the private key; if it is a public key, it will export the public key.
We can write functions to backup our private key (which <strong>absolutely</strong>
needs to be kept secure) and a function to export our public key, suitable for
uploading to our web page or to a PKI keystore:
```
# backup our key, whether public or private
def export_key(filename, key):
    try:
        f = open(filename, 'w')
    except IOError as e:
        print e
        raise e
    else:
        f.write( key.exportKey() )
        f.close()</p>

<p># will only export the public key
def export_pubkey(filename, key):
    try:
        f = open(filename, 'w')
    except IOError as e:
        print e
        raise e
    else:
        f.write( key.publickey().exportKey() )
        f.close()
```</p>

<p>Importing a key is done using the <code>RSA.importKey</code> function:
<code>def load_key(filename):
    try:
        f = open(filename)
    except IOError as e:
        print e
        raise
    else:
        key = Crypto.PublicKey.RSA.importKey(f.read())
        f.close()
        return key</code></p>

<p>We can take a look at the difference between the public and private keys:
```</p>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Using the <code>export_pubkey()</code> function, you can pass that file
around to people to encrypt messages to you. Often, you wil want to generate a 
keypair to give to people. One convention is to name the secret key 
<code>keyname.prv</code> (prv for private, and sometimes <code>keyname.key</code>) and the 
public key <code>keyname.pub</code>. We will
follow that convention in an <code>export_keypair()</code> function:
```
def export_keypair(basename, key):
    pubkeyfile   = basename + '.pub'
    prvkeyfile   = basename + '.prv'</p>

<pre><code>export_key(prvkeyfile, key)
export_pubkey(pubkeyfile, key)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>For example, Bob generates a keypair and emails the public key to Alice:
```</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>key = publickey.generate_key( 1024 )
      key.size()
      1023
      key.has_private()
      True
      publickey.export_keypair('bob.prv', key)</p>
      
      <p>```</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, Assuming Bob gave Alice <code>bob.pub</code>:
```</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>bob = publickey.load_key('./bob.pub')
      message = 'secret message from Alice to Bob'
      print publickey.encrypt(bob, message)

      rqo8qLd9Mw6TerM8gs8=
      ```</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The ASCII-armoured format makes it convenient for Alice to paste the encrypted
message to Bob, so she does, and now Bob has it on his computer. To read it, he
does something similar:
```</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>bob = publickey.load_key('tests/bob.prv')
      print publickey.decrypt(bob, message)
      secret message from Alice to Bob
      ```</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point, Bob can't be sure that the message came from Alice but he can 
read the message. We'll cover entity authentication in a later section, but
first, there's something else I'd to point out:</p>

<p>You might have noticed at this point that public key cryptography appears to
be a lot simpler than symmetric key cryptography. The key distribution problem
is certainly easier, especially with a proper PKI. Why would anyone choose to
use symmetric key cryptography over public key cryptography? The answer is
performance: if you compare the block cipher test code with the public
key test code, you will notice that the block cipher code is orders of magnitude
faster - and it generates far more keys than the public key code. There is a 
solution to this problem: hybrid cryptosystems.</p>

<p>Hybrid cryptosystems use public key cryptography to establish a symmetric 
session key. Both <strong>TLS</strong> (Transport Layer Security), and its predecessor 
<strong>SSL</strong> (Secure Sockets Layer), most often used to secure HTTP transactions, 
use a hybrid cryptosystem to speed up establishing a secure session. PGP 
also uses hybrid crypto.</p>

<p>Let's say Alice and Bob wish to use hybrid crypto; if Alice initiates the 
session, she should be the one to generate the session key. For example,
```</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>import block, publickey
      session_key = block.generate_aes_key()
      alice_key   = publickey.load_key('keys/alice.prv')
      bob_key     = publickey.load_key('keys/bob.pub')
      encrypted_session_key = encrypt( bob_key, session_key )
      ```</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point, Alice should send Bob the <code>encrypted_session_key</code>; she 
should retain a copy as well. They can then use this key to communicate using
the much-faster AES256.</p>

<p>In communicating, it might be wise to create a message format that packs in 
the session key into a header, and encrypts the rest of the body with the
session key. This is a subject beyond the realm of a quick tutorial - again,
consult with the people who do this on a regular basis.</p>

<h2 id="digital-signatures">1.5 Digital Signatures</h2>

<p>In all of the previous examples, we assumed that the identity of the sender
wasn't a question. For a symmetric key, that's less of a stretch - there's no 
differentiation between owners. Public keys, however, are supposed to be
associated with an entity. How can we prove the identity of the user? Without
delving into too much into social sciences and trust metrics and a huge
philosophical argument, let's look at the basics of signatures.</p>

<p>A signature works similarly to encryption, but it in reverse, and it is slightly
different: a hash of the message is 'encrypted' by the private key to the 
public key. The public key is used to 'decrypt' this ciphertext. Contrast this 
to actual public key encryption: the entire message is encrypted to the private 
key by the public key, and the private key is used to decrypt the ciphertext. 
With signatures, the 'encrypted' hash of the message is called the signature,
and the act of 'encryption' is termed 'signing'. Similarly, the 'decryption' 
is known as verification or verifying the signature.</p>

<p>PyCrypto's PublicKey implementations already come with signatures and 
verification methods for keys using <code>sign()</code> and <code>verify()</code>. The signature
is a long in a tuple:
```</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>key.sign( d, None )
      (1738423518152671545669571445860037944518162197656333123466248015147955424248

      ```</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>We can write our own functions to wrap around these two functions and perform 
ASCII-armouring if desired. Our signature function should take a key and a 
message (and optionally a flag to ASCII armour the signature), and sign a 
digest of the message:
```
def sign(key, message, armour = True):
    if not key.can_sign(): 
        return None</p>

<pre><code>digest      = Crypto.Hash.SHA256.new(message).digest()
signature   = key.sign( digest, None )[0]

if armour:
    sig     = base64.encodestring( str(signature) )
else:
    sig     = str( signature )

return sig.strip()
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The signature is converted to a string to make it easier to pack it into 
structures and also to give us consistent input to the verify() function.</p>

<p>Verifying the signature requires that we determine if the signature is ASCII-
armoured or not, then comparing a digest of the message to the signature:
```
def verify(key, message, signature):
    try:
        sig     = long( signature )
    except ValueError as e:
        sig     = long( base64.decodestring( signature.rstrip('\n') ), )</p>

<pre><code>digest      = Crypto.Hash.SHA256.new(message).digest()
return key.verify( digest, (sig, ) )
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The <code>sign()</code> function returns a signature and the <code>verify()</code> function returns a 
boolean. Now, Alice can sign her message to Bob, and Bob knows the key belongs
to Alice. She sends Bob the signature and the encrypted message. Bob then makes
sure Alice's key properly verifies the signature to the encrypted message.</p>

<h2 id="key-exchange">1.6 Key Exchange</h2>

<p>So how does Bob know the key actually belongs to Alice? There are two main
schools of thought regarding the authentication of key ownership: centralised
and decentralised. TLS/SSL follow the centralised school: a root 
certificate (a certificate is a public key encoded with X.509 and which
can have additional informational attributes attached, such as organisation
name and country) authority (CA) signs intermediary CA keys, which then sign
user keys. For example, if Bob runs Foo Widgets, LLC, he can generate an SSL
keypair. From this, he generates a certificate signing request, and sends this
to the CA. The CA, usually after taking some money and ostensibly actually
verifying Bob's identity (the extent to which this actually happens 
varies widely based on the different CAs), then signs Bob's certificate. Bob
sets up his webserver to use his SSL certificate for all secure traffic, and
Alice sees that the CA did in fact sign his certificate. This relies on trusted
central authorities, like VeriSign (there is some question as to whether
VeriSign can actually be trusted, but that is another discussion for another
day...) Alice's web browser would ship with a keystore of select trusted CA
public keys (like VeriSign's) that she could use to verify signatures on the
certificates from various sites. This system is called a public key 
infrastructure.</p>

<p>The other school of thought is followed by PGP (and GnuPG) - the 
decentralised model. In PGP, this is manifested as the 
<a href="http://www.rubin.ch/pgp/weboftrust.en.html">Web of Trust</a>. 
For example, if Carol now wants to talk to Bob and gives Bob her public key,
Bob can check to see if Carol's key has been signed by anyone else. We'll also
say that Bob knows for a fact that Alice's key belongs to Alice, and he trusts
her&mdash;it is quite often important to distinguish between 
<em>I know this key belongs to that user</em> and <em>I trust that user</em>, which
is especially important with key signatures - if Bob cannot trust
Alice to properly check identities, she might sign a key for an identity she hasn't
checked&mdash;and that Alice has signed Carol's key. Bob sees Alice's signature on
Carol's key and then can be reasonably sure that Carol is who she says it was.
If we repeat the process with Dave, whose key was signed by Carol (whose key
was signed by Alice), Bob might be able to be more certain that the key belongs
to Dave, but maybe he doesn't really trust Carol to properly verify identities.
In PGP, Bob can mark keys as having various trust levels, and from this a web
of trust emerges: a picture of how well you can trust that a given key belongs
to a given user.</p>

<p>The key distribution problem is not a quick and easy problem to solve; a lot of
very smart people have spent a lot of time coming up with solutions to the
problem. There are key exchange protocols (such as the 
<a href="http://is.gd/Tr0zLP">Diffie-Hellman key exchange</a>
and IKE (Internet Key Exchange, defined in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2409.txt">RFC 2409</a>
(which uses Diffie-Hellman) that provide alternatives to the web of trust and
public key infrastructures.</p>

<h1 id="practical-introduction-to-cryptography-3"><span>Chapter 2 </span> Practical Introduction to Cryptography</h1>

<h2 id="introduction-4">2.1 Introduction</h2>

<p>This chapter is adapter from my introductory article to cryptography. We'll take
a quick, high-level overview of cryptography. The 
<a href="https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/">PyCrypto</a> and
<a href="http://www.mindrot.org/projects/py-bcrypt/">py-bcrypt</a> libraries will be used
to illustrate some general things to know when writing cryptographic code. 
We'll take a look at symmetric, public-key, hybrid, cryptographic hashing, 
password hashing, and message authentication codes.</p>

<p>Some quick terminology: for those unfamiliar, it's important to know what these 
mean:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>plaintext</strong>: the original message</li>
<li><strong>ciphertext</strong>: the message after cryptographic transformations are applied 
to obscure the original message.</li>
<li><strong>encrypt</strong>: producing ciphertext by applying cryptographic transformations
to plaintext.</li>
<li><strong>decrypt</strong>: producing plaintext by applying cryptographic transformations to
ciphertext.</li>
<li><strong>cipher</strong>: a particular set of cryptographic transformations providing means
of both encryption and decryption.    </li>
<li><strong>ciphersystem</strong>: a set of cryptographic transformations that take a large input and
transform it to a unique (typically fixed-size) output. For hashes to be
cryptographically secure, collisions should be practically nonexistent. It
should be practically impossible to determine the input from the output.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cryptography is an often misunderstood component of information security. We 
covered some information security principles in the previous chapter; the 
ones that cryptography covers are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>privacy</strong> (aka <strong>confidentiality</strong>).    </li>
<li><strong>data integrity</strong>: the plaintext message arrives unaltered.     </li>
<li><strong>entity authentication</strong>: the identity of the sender is verified. An entity
may be a person or a machine.   </li>
<li><strong>message authentication</strong>: the message is verified as having been 
unaltered.     </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that cryptography is used to obscure the contents of a message and verify
its contents and source. It will <strong>not</strong> hide the fact that two entities are 
communicating.</p>

<p>There are two basic types of ciphers: symmetric and public-key ciphers. A 
symmetric key cipher employs the use of shared secret keys. They also tend to
be much faster than public-key ciphers. A public-key cipher is so-called because
each key consists of a private key which is used to generate a public key. Like
their names imply, the private key is kept secret while the public key is 
passed around. First, I'll take a look at a specific type of symmetric ciphers:
block ciphers.</p>

<h2 id="block-ciphers-3">2.2 Block Ciphers</h2>

<p>There are two further types of symmetric keys: stream and block ciphers. Stream
ciphers operate on data streams, i.e. one byte at a time. Block ciphers operate
on blocks of data, typically 16 bytes at a time. The most common block cipher
and the standard one you should use unless you have a very good reason to use
another one is the AES block cipher, documented in 
<a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf">FIPS PUB 197</a>.
AES is a specific subset of the Rijndael cipher. AES uses block size of 
128-bits (16 bytes); data should be padded out to fit the block size - the
length of the data block must be multiple of the block size. For example, 
given an input of <code>ABCDABCDABCDABCD ABCDABCDABCDABCD</code> no padding would
need to be done. However, given <code>ABCDABCDABCDABCD ABCDABCDABCD</code> an 
additional 4 bytes of padding would need to be added. A common padding scheme 
is to use <code>0x80</code> as the first byte of padding, with <code>{0x00</code> bytes 
filling out the rest of the padding. With padding, the previous example would 
look like: <code>ABCDABCDABCDABCD ABCDABCDABCD\x80\x00\x00\x00</code>.</p>

<p>Writing a padding function is pretty easy:<br />
```
def pad_data(data):
    # return data if no padding is required
    if len(data) % 16 == 0: 
        return data</p>

<pre><code># subtract one byte that should be the 0x80
# if 0 bytes of padding are required, it means only
# a single \x80 is required.

padding_required     = 15 - (len(data) % 16)

data = '%s\x80' % data
data = '%s%s' % (data, '\x00' * padding_required)

return data
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Similarly, removing padding is also easy:
```
def unpad_data(data):
    if not data: 
        return data</p>

<pre><code>data = data.rstrip('\x00')
    if data[-1] == '\x80':
        return data[:-1]
    else:
        return data
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>I've included these functions in the 
<a href="http://www.kyleisom.net/publish/datasec/code/chapter1.tar.gz">example code</a>
for the book.</p>

<p>Encryption with a block cipher requires selecting a 
<a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/index.html">block mode</a>.
By far the most common mode used is <strong>cipher block chaining</strong> or 
<em>CBC</em> mode. Other modes include <strong>counter (CTR)</strong>, 
<strong>cipher feedback (CFB)</strong>, and the extremely insecure
<strong>electronic codebook (ECB)</strong>. CBC mode is the standard and is 
well-vetted, so I will stick to that in this tutorial. Cipher block chaining 
works by XORing the previous block of ciphertext with the current block. You 
might recognise that the first block has nothing to be XOR'd with; enter the 
<em><a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/nonce.pdf">initialisation vector</a></em>. 
This comprises a number of randomly-generated bytes of data the same
size as the cipher's block size. This initialisation vector should random 
enough that it cannot be recovered; one manner of doing this is to combine a
standard UNIX timestamp with a block-size group of random data, using a standard
hashing algorithm such as MD5 to make it unique.</p>

<p>One of the most critical components to encryption is properly generating 
random data. Fortunately, most of this is handled by the PyCrypto library's
<code>Crypto.Random.OSRNG module</code>. You should know that the more entropy sources
available (such as network traffic and disk activity), the faster the system
can generate cryptographically-secure random data. I've written a function that 
can generate a <em>cryptographic nonce</em> (an number used only once)
suitable for use as an initialisation vector. This will work on a UNIX machine; 
the comments note how easy it is to adapt it to a Windows machine. This 
function requires a version of PyCrypto at least 2.1.0 or higher.
```
import time
import Crypto.Random.OSRNG.posix</p>

<p>def generate_nonce():
    rnd = Crypto.Random.OSRNG.posix.new().read(BLOCK_SIZE)
    rnd = '%s%s' % (rnd, str(time.time()))
    nonce = Crypto.Hash.MD5.new(data = rnd)</p>

<pre><code>return nonce.digest()
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>I will note here that the python <code>random</code> module is completely unsuitable for
cryptography (as it is completely deterministic). You shouldn't use it for
cryptographic code. If you're using another language, you need to be careful
to select a cryptographically-secure random number generator (RNG).</p>

<p>Symmetric ciphers are so-named because the key is shared across any entities.
There are three key sizes for AES: 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit, aka 16-byte,
24-byte, and 32-byte key sizes. If you want to use a passphrase, you 
should use a digest algorithm that produces an appropriately sized digest, and
hash that passphrase. For example, for AES-256, you would want to use SHA-256.
Here is a sample function to generate an AES-256 key from a passphrase:
```
# generate an AES-256 key from a passphrase
def passphrase(password, readable = False):
    """
    Converts a passphrase to a format suitable for use as an AES key.</p>

<pre><code>If readable is set to True, the key is output as a hex digest. This is
suitable for sharing with users or printing to screen when debugging
code.

By default readable is set to False, in which case the value it 
returns is suitable for use directly as an AES-256 key.
"""
key     = Crypto.Hash.SHA256.new(password)

if readable:
    return key.hexdigest()
else:
    return key.digest()
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>We could include this a set of AES encryption and decryption functions:
```
mode = Crypto.Cipher.AES.MODE_CBC       # shortcut to clean up code</p>

<p># AES-256 encryption using a passphrase
def passphrase_encrypt(password, iv, data):
    key     = passphrase(password)
    data    = pad_data(data)
    aes     = Crypto.Cipher.AES.new(key, mode, iv)</p>

<pre><code>return aes.encrypt(data)
</code></pre>

<p># AES-256 decryption using a passphrase
def passphrase_decrypt(password, iv, data):
    key     = passphrase(password)
    aes     = Crypto.Cipher.AES.new(key, mode, iv)
    data    = aes.decrypt(data)</p>

<pre><code>return unpad_data(data)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Notice how the data is padded before being encrypted and unpadded after 
decryption - the decryption process will not remove the padding on its own.</p>

<p>Unless you are you doing interactive encryption passphrase encryption won't be
terribly useful. Instead, we just need to generate 32 random bytes (and make
sure we keep track of it) and use that as the key:
<code># generate a random AES-256 key
def generate_aes_key():
    rnd     = Crypto.Random.OSRNG.posix.new().read(KEY_SIZE)
    return rnd</code></p>

<p>We can use this key directly in the AES transformations:
```
def encrypt(key, iv, data):
    aes     = Crypto.Cipher.AES.new(key, mode, iv)
    data    = pad_data(data)</p>

<pre><code>return aes.encrypt(data)
</code></pre>

<p>def decrypt(key, iv, data):
    aes     = Crypto.Cipher.AES.new(key, mode, iv)
    data    = aes.decrypt(data)</p>

<pre><code>return unpad_data(data)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>That should cover the basics of block cipher encryption. We've gone over key
generation, padding, and encryption / decryption. AES-256 isn't the only 
block cipher provided by the PyCrypto package, but again: it is the standard
and well vetted.</p>

<h2 id="ascii-armouring-3">2.3 ASCII-Armouring</h2>

<p>I'm going to take a quick detour and talk about ASCII armouring. If you've 
played with the crypto functions above, you'll notice they produce an annoying
dump of binary data that can be a hassle to deal with. One common technique for
making the data a little bit easier to deal with is to encode it with 
base64 (which is defined in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1521.html">RFC 1521</a>. 
There are a few ways to incorporate this into python:</p>

<h3 id="absolute-base64-encoding-3">2.3.1 Absolute Base64 Encoding</h3>

<p>The easiest way is to just base64 encode everything in the encrypt function. 
Everything that goes into the decrypt function should be in base64 - if it's 
not, the <code>base64</code> module will throw an error: you could catch this and 
then try to decode it as binary data.</p>

<h3 id="a-simple-header-3">2.3.2 A Simple Header</h3>

<p>A slightly more complex option, and the one I adopt in this article, is to use 
a <code>x00</code> as the first byte of the ciphertext for binary data, and to use 
<code>\x41</code> (an ASCII "<code>A</code>'') for ASCII encoded data. This will increase 
the complexity of the encryption and decryption functions slightly. We'll also 
pack the initialisation vector at the beginning of the file as well. Given now 
that the <code>iv</code> argument might be <code>None</code> in the decrypt function, I 
will have to rearrange the arguments a bit; for consistency, I will move it in 
both functions. I leave adding it into the <code>passphrase_encrypt</code> and 
<code>passphrase_decrypt</code> functions as an exercise for the reader. My modified 
functions look like this now:
```
def encrypt(key, data, iv, armour = False):
    aes     = Crypto.Cipher.AES.new(key, mode, iv)
    data    = pad_data(data)
    ct      = aes.encrypt(data)         # ciphertext
    ct      = iv + ct                   # pack the initialisation vector in</p>

<pre><code># ascii-armouring
if armour:
    ct = '\x41' + base64.encodestring(ct)
else:
    ct = '\x00' + ct

return ct
</code></pre>

<p>def decrypt(key, data, iv = None):
    # remove ascii-armouring if present
    if data[0] == '\x00':
        data = data[1:]
    elif data[0] == '\x41':
        data = base64.decodestring(data[1:])</p>

<pre><code>iv      = data[:16]
data    = data[16:]
aes     = Crypto.Cipher.AES.new(key, mode, iv)
data    = aes.decrypt(data)
return unpad_data(data)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h3 id="a-more-complex-container-3">2.3.3 A More Complex Container</h3>

<p>There are more complex ways to do it (and you'll see it with the public keys 
in the next section) that involve putting the base64 into a container of sorts
that contains additional information about the key.</p>

<h2 id="public-key-cryptography-3">2.4 Public Key Cryptography</h2>

<p>Now it is time to take a look at public-key cryptography. Public-key 
cryptography, or PKC, involves the use of two-part keys. The private key is
the sensitive key that should be kept private by the owning entity, whereas the
public key (which is generated from the private key) is meant to be distributed
to any entities which must communicate securely with the entity owning the 
private key. Confusing? Let's look at this using the venerable Alice and Bob,
patron saints of cryptography.</p>

<p>Alice wants to talk to Bob, but doesn't want Eve to know the contents of the
message. Both Alice and Bob generate a set of private keys. From those private
keys, they both generate public keys. Let's say they post their public keys on
their websites. Alice wants to send a private message to Bob, so she looks up
Bob's public key from his site. (In fact, there is a way to distribute keys via
a central site or entity; this is called a public key infrastructure (PKI). The 
public key can be used as the key to encrypt a message with PKC. The resulting 
ciphertext can only be decrypted using Bob's private key. Alice sends Bob the 
resulting ciphertext, which Eve cannot decrypt without Bob's private key. 
Hopefully this is a little less confusing.</p>

<p>One of the most common PKC systems is RSA (which is an acronym for the last 
names of the designers of the algorithm). Generally, RSA keys are 1024-bit,
2048-bit, or 4096-bits long. The keys are most often in 
PEM (defined in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1421">RFCs 1421-1424</a>)
or 
<a href="http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/languages/X.690-0207.pdf">DER</a>
format. Generating RSA keys with PyCrypto is extremely easy:
```
def generate_key(size):
    PRNG    = Crypto.Random.OSRNG.posix.new().read
    key     = Crypto.PublicKey.RSA.generate(size, PRNG)</p>

<pre><code>return key
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The <code>key</code> that is returned isn't like the keys we used with the block ciphers:
it is an RSA object and comes with several useful built-in methods. One of 
these is the <code>size()</code> method, which returns the size of the key in bits minus
one. For example:
```</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>import publickey
      key = publickey.generate_key( 1024 )
      key.size()
      1023</p>
      
      <p>```</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>A quick note: I will use 1024-bit keys in this tutorial because they are 
faster to generate, but in practice you should be using at least 2048-bit 
keys. The key also includes encryption and decryption methods in the class:
```</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>import publickey
      import base64
      message = 'Test message...'
      ciphertext = key.encrypt(message, None)
      print base64.encodestring(ciphertext[0])
      gzA9gXfHqnkValdhhYjRVVSxuygx48i66h0vFUnmVu8FZXJtmaACvNDo43D0vjjHzFiblE1eCFiI
      xlhVuHxldWXJSnARgWX1bTY7imR9Hve+WQC8rl+qB5xpq3xnKH7/z8/5YdLvCo/knXYE1cI/XYJP
      EP1nA6bUZNj6bD1Zx4w=
      ```</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>None</code> that is passed into the encryption function is part of the 
PyCrypto API for those publickey ciphers requiring an additional random number 
function to be passed in. It returns a tuple containing only the encrypted 
message. In order to pass this to the decryption function, we need to pass only 
the encrypted message as a string:
```</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>ciphertext = key.encrypt(message, None)[0]
      key.decrypt(ciphertext)
      'Test message...'
      ```</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>While these are simple enough, we could put them into a pair of functions that
also include ASCII-armouring:
```
def encrypt(key, message, armour = True):
    ciphertext  = key.encrypt( message, None )
    ciphertext  = ciphertext[0]</p>

<pre><code>if armour:
    ciphertext = '\x41' + base64.encodestring( ciphertext )
else:
    ciphertext = '\x00' + base64.encodestring( ciphertext )

return ciphertext
</code></pre>

<p>def decrypt(key, message):
    if   '\x00' == message[0]:
        message = message[1:]
    elif '\x41' == message[0]:
        message == base64.decodestring( message[1:] )</p>

<pre><code>plaintext   = key.decrypt( message )
    return plaintext
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>These two functions present a common API that will simplify encryption and
decryption and make it a little easier to read. Assuming we still have the same
<code>message</code> definition as before:
```</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>ciphertext = publickey.encrypt(key, message)
      publickey.decrypt(key, ciphertext)
          'Test message...'
      ```</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, what if we want to export this generated key and read it in later? The key
comes with the method <code>exportKey()</code>. If the key is a private key, it will
export the private key; if it is a public key, it will export the public key.
We can write functions to backup our private key (which <strong>absolutely</strong>
needs to be kept secure) and a function to export our public key, suitable for
uploading to our web page or to a PKI keystore:
```
# backup our key, whether public or private
def export_key(filename, key):
    try:
        f = open(filename, 'w')
    except IOError as e:
        print e
        raise e
    else:
        f.write( key.exportKey() )
        f.close()</p>

<p># will only export the public key
def export_pubkey(filename, key):
    try:
        f = open(filename, 'w')
    except IOError as e:
        print e
        raise e
    else:
        f.write( key.publickey().exportKey() )
        f.close()
```</p>

<p>Importing a key is done using the <code>RSA.importKey</code> function:
<code>def load_key(filename):
    try:
        f = open(filename)
    except IOError as e:
        print e
        raise
    else:
        key = Crypto.PublicKey.RSA.importKey(f.read())
        f.close()
        return key</code></p>

<p>We can take a look at the difference between the public and private keys:
```</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>key = publickey.generate_key( 1024 )
      print key.exportKey()
      -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

<p>Using the <code>export_pubkey()</code> function, you can pass that file
around to people to encrypt messages to you. Often, you wil want to generate a 
keypair to give to people. One convention is to name the secret key 
<code>keyname.prv</code> (prv for private, and sometimes <code>keyname.key</code>) and the 
public key <code>keyname.pub</code>. We will
follow that convention in an <code>export_keypair()</code> function:
```
def export_keypair(basename, key):
    pubkeyfile   = basename + '.pub'
    prvkeyfile   = basename + '.prv'</p>

<pre><code>export_key(prvkeyfile, key)
export_pubkey(pubkeyfile, key)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>For example, Bob generates a keypair and emails the public key to Alice:
```</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>key = publickey.generate_key( 1024 )
      key.size()
      1023
      key.has_private()
      True
      publickey.export_keypair('bob.prv', key)</p>
      
      <p>```</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, Assuming Bob gave Alice <code>bob.pub</code>:
```</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>bob = publickey.load_key('./bob.pub')
      message = 'secret message from Alice to Bob'
      print publickey.encrypt(bob, message)
      AN6RsuXEeKicUZKtZCsDeqGKeB5em+NG/bgoqr9l8ij2o1Gr9sT69tv0zxgmigK/Jt+gPxg/EDu61
      nHmAK0XQV7BvJS5jLuBxdJ0mEpysVClu46XN1KHU2l2DsGht9e8OFvhEfDkI5t/cy/gXr0xz/EUi
      rqo8qLd9Mw6TerM8gs8=
      ```</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The ASCII-armoured format makes it convenient for Alice to paste the encrypted
message to Bob, so she does, and now Bob has it on his computer. To read it, he
does something similar:
```</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>bob = publickey.load_key('tests/bob.prv')
      print publickey.decrypt(bob, message)
      secret message from Alice to Bob
      ```</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point, Bob can't be sure that the message came from Alice but he can 
read the message. We'll cover entity authentication in a later section, but
first, there's something else I'd to point out:</p>

<p>You might have noticed at this point that public key cryptography appears to
be a lot simpler than symmetric key cryptography. The key distribution problem
is certainly easier, especially with a proper PKI. Why would anyone choose to
use symmetric key cryptography over public key cryptography? The answer is
performance: if you compare the block cipher test code with the public
key test code, you will notice that the block cipher code is orders of magnitude
faster - and it generates far more keys than the public key code. There is a 
solution to this problem: hybrid cryptosystems.</p>

<p>Hybrid cryptosystems use public key cryptography to establish a symmetric 
session key. Both <strong>TLS</strong> (Transport Layer Security), and its predecessor 
<strong>SSL</strong> (Secure Sockets Layer), most often used to secure HTTP transactions, 
use a hybrid cryptosystem to speed up establishing a secure session. PGP 
also uses hybrid crypto.</p>

<p>Let's say Alice and Bob wish to use hybrid crypto; if Alice initiates the 
session, she should be the one to generate the session key. For example,
```</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>import block, publickey
      session_key = block.generate_aes_key()
      alice_key   = publickey.load_key('keys/alice.prv')
      bob_key     = publickey.load_key('keys/bob.pub')
      encrypted_session_key = encrypt( bob_key, session_key )
      ```</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point, Alice should send Bob the <code>encrypted_session_key</code>; she 
should retain a copy as well. They can then use this key to communicate using
the much-faster AES256.</p>

<p>In communicating, it might be wise to create a message format that packs in 
the session key into a header, and encrypts the rest of the body with the
session key. This is a subject beyond the realm of a quick tutorial - again,
consult with the people who do this on a regular basis.</p>

<h2 id="digital-signatures-3">2.5 Digital Signatures</h2>

<p>In all of the previous examples, we assumed that the identity of the sender
wasn't a question. For a symmetric key, that's less of a stretch - there's no 
differentiation between owners. Public keys, however, are supposed to be
associated with an entity. How can we prove the identity of the user? Without
delving into too much into social sciences and trust metrics and a huge
philosophical argument, let's look at the basics of signatures.</p>

<p>A signature works similarly to encryption, but it in reverse, and it is slightly
different: a hash of the message is 'encrypted' by the private key to the 
public key. The public key is used to 'decrypt' this ciphertext. Contrast this 
to actual public key encryption: the entire message is encrypted to the private 
key by the public key, and the private key is used to decrypt the ciphertext. 
With signatures, the 'encrypted' hash of the message is called the signature,
and the act of 'encryption' is termed 'signing'. Similarly, the 'decryption' 
is known as verification or verifying the signature.</p>

<p>PyCrypto's PublicKey implementations already come with signatures and 
verification methods for keys using <code>sign()</code> and <code>verify()</code>. The signature
is a long in a tuple:
```</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>key.sign( d, None )
      (1738423518152671545669571445860037944518162197656333123466248015147955424248
      876723731383711018550231967374810686606623315483033485630977014574359346192927942
      623807461783144628656796225504478196458051789241311033020911767301220653148276004
      0551357526383627059382081878791040169815009051016949220178044764130908L,)
      ```</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>We can write our own functions to wrap around these two functions and perform 
ASCII-armouring if desired. Our signature function should take a key and a 
message (and optionally a flag to ASCII armour the signature), and sign a 
digest of the message:
```
def sign(key, message, armour = True):
    if not key.can_sign(): 
        return None</p>

<pre><code>digest      = Crypto.Hash.SHA256.new(message).digest()
signature   = key.sign( digest, None )[0]

if armour:
    sig     = base64.encodestring( str(signature) )
else:
    sig     = str( signature )

return sig.strip()
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The signature is converted to a string to make it easier to pack it into 
structures and also to give us consistent input to the verify() function.</p>

<p>Verifying the signature requires that we determine if the signature is ASCII-
armoured or not, then comparing a digest of the message to the signature:
```
def verify(key, message, signature):
    try:
        sig     = long( signature )
    except ValueError as e:
        sig     = long( base64.decodestring( signature.rstrip('\n') ), )</p>

<pre><code>digest      = Crypto.Hash.SHA256.new(message).digest()
return key.verify( digest, (sig, ) )
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The <code>sign()</code> function returns a signature and the <code>verify()</code> function returns a 
boolean. Now, Alice can sign her message to Bob, and Bob knows the key belongs
to Alice. She sends Bob the signature and the encrypted message. Bob then makes
sure Alice's key properly verifies the signature to the encrypted message.</p>

<h2 id="key-exchange-3">2.6 Key Exchange</h2>

<p>So how does Bob know the key actually belongs to Alice? There are two main
schools of thought regarding the authentication of key ownership: centralised
and decentralised. TLS/SSL follow the centralised school: a root 
certificate (a certificate is a public key encoded with X.509 and which
can have additional informational attributes attached, such as organisation
name and country) authority (CA) signs intermediary CA keys, which then sign
user keys. For example, if Bob runs Foo Widgets, LLC, he can generate an SSL
keypair. From this, he generates a certificate signing request, and sends this
to the CA. The CA, usually after taking some money and ostensibly actually
verifying Bob's identity (the extent to which this actually happens 
varies widely based on the different CAs), then signs Bob's certificate. Bob
sets up his webserver to use his SSL certificate for all secure traffic, and
Alice sees that the CA did in fact sign his certificate. This relies on trusted
central authorities, like VeriSign (there is some question as to whether
VeriSign can actually be trusted, but that is another discussion for another
day...) Alice's web browser would ship with a keystore of select trusted CA
public keys (like VeriSign's) that she could use to verify signatures on the
certificates from various sites. This system is called a public key 
infrastructure.</p>

<p>The other school of thought is followed by PGP (and GnuPG) - the 
decentralised model. In PGP, this is manifested as the 
<a href="http://www.rubin.ch/pgp/weboftrust.en.html">Web of Trust</a>. 
For example, if Carol now wants to talk to Bob and gives Bob her public key,
Bob can check to see if Carol's key has been signed by anyone else. We'll also
say that Bob knows for a fact that Alice's key belongs to Alice, and he trusts
her&mdash;it is quite often important to distinguish between 
<em>I know this key belongs to that user</em> and <em>I trust that user</em>, which
is especially important with key signatures - if Bob cannot trust
Alice to properly check identities, she might sign a key for an identity she hasn't
checked&mdash;and that Alice has signed Carol's key. Bob sees Alice's signature on
Carol's key and then can be reasonably sure that Carol is who she says it was.
If we repeat the process with Dave, whose key was signed by Carol (whose key
was signed by Alice), Bob might be able to be more certain that the key belongs
to Dave, but maybe he doesn't really trust Carol to properly verify identities.
In PGP, Bob can mark keys as having various trust levels, and from this a web
of trust emerges: a picture of how well you can trust that a given key belongs
to a given user.</p>

<p>The key distribution problem is not a quick and easy problem to solve; a lot of
very smart people have spent a lot of time coming up with solutions to the
problem. There are key exchange protocols (such as the 
<a href="http://is.gd/Tr0zLP">Diffie-Hellman key exchange</a>
and IKE (Internet Key Exchange, defined in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2409.txt">RFC 2409</a>
(which uses Diffie-Hellman) that provide alternatives to the web of trust and
public key infrastructures.</p>
