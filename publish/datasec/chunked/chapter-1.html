<p><strong>Threat modeling</strong> is the art of thinking about what threats your
application will face. By understanding the threats, you can begin thinking
about how to mitigate them.</p>

<p>One useful tool when threat modeling is an <strong>attack tree</strong>. In an attack tree,
you identify what threats you might face, and what those attacks lead to. During
the initial stages, you don't focus on mitigation (or what you have done so far).
It's important to consider what sorts of attacks can be made: while you might
think an attack is mitigated or you may not see it as practical, changes to the
code can easily change the situation. It's important to regularly review the
attack tree, updating it as necessary. If you add a feature, consider the 
potential security impact. The point of the attack tree is just to visualise 
what could happen; later parts of the security engineering process transform
this into a practical outlook.</p>

<p>Let's consider a simple web site that allows users to update their information;
it's backed by a fairly simple database. Some potential attack vectors that 
come to mind in a quick overview are:</p>

<ol>
<li>SQL injection on the login form -> privilege escalation</li>
<li>password interception on the wire -> stealing user's account information</li>
<li>password brute forcing -> stealing user's account information</li>
<li>unauthorised access to resources, i.e. user B can read or update user A's
information without their consent.</li>
</ol>

<p>It's also helpful to identify vulnerability points with these:</p>

<ol>
<li>login form (SQL injection, password brute forcing)</li>
<li>the wire, i.e. the connection between the user and the server (password
interception)</li>
<li>whereever user information can be looked up</li>
</ol>

<p>From here, we can identify mitigation steps fairly easily:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sanitize all user inputs.</li>
<li>Secure the connection using SSL.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt">bcrypt</a> to store passwords.</li>
<li>Force all sensitive information to be routed through authorisation 
middleware.</li>
</ol>

<p>Generally, it's good practise to keep these in separate documents; i.e. an
attack tree (though often annotated with the vulnerability points), and
a security plan. This allows you to consider the two separately when needed.
The security plan should reference the attack tree in considering what 
attacks are being defended against.</p>
