    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Inexplicably, for the longest time I was reticent to enable any sort of
analytics on my personal site. Partially because, to be honest, it's not
as if my blog is well read (or so I assume, but soon I'll have numbers
to back that claim up). As I try to get more involved in the world, I've
found my site is useful as a portfolio of sorts - not so much in the way
of "look at my sexy site" as "here's the cool things I do". I've noticed
that <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> has had some DDoS issues lately, and as
I host this site on my <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>, I wanted
to minimise any potential downtimes. I'd also noticed that some of my
pages were a bit on the slow side to load, as <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>
appears to load quite a bit of javascript. I admit to being a fan of many of
the asides, and to have written some of my own.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In order to improve this situation, I took two steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>I enabled Google Analytics:
while I'm not a particular fan of feeding the privacy black hole with even more
data, it appears to be the only viable option at this time. I have been eyeing
<a href="http://haveamint.com/">Mint</a>, but I am abstaining from purchasing anything new
until I leave the Netherlands (in a little over a week) just to stay on the
safe side of my bank account. (30 USD may not sound like much, but that's about
two days worth of d√∂ner or shawarma for dinner.)</li>
<li>I set up the site on CloudFlare.</li>
</ol>


<p>What I didn't realise is that several of my older posts actually rank high on
Google's search results; however, the link on Google points to the old url
from when I was using <a href="http://blaze.blackened.cz">blazeblogger</a>. Because the
content is actually useful documentation, I was able to set up redirects so
that the page is back online and people can use the information now.</p>
