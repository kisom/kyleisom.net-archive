  <p>Data security is one of those things you hear a lot about, but most of us
are busy getting things done; unfortunately for our users, data security
tends to be put on the back-burner, if we remember it at all. Data security
doesn&#8217;t have to be a burden on the developer, and most importantly, it&#8217;s in
the best interest of users. One principle I particularly like for software
engineering is the Principle of Least Astonishment.</p>

<p><strong><em>THE PRINCIPLE OF LEAST ASTONISHMENT:</em></strong><br>
<em>A program&#8217;s behaviour should not surprise the end user.</em></p>

<p>How does this relate to data security? A user never expects their data to be
leaked out of the application or their information to be shared with people
they dont intend for it to. This might be an explicit understanding or an
implicit one, especially when users don&#8217;t really understand the problem
domain. If your users are from a wide range of backgrounds, they may not
have a solid understanding of the basics of how to keep their information
safe. In fact, they may not even realise what they don&#8217;t know. So, it
becomes even more important for developers to ensure that, as much as
possible, their data is safe. What I will discuss in this book are ways to
do that, while keeping in mind the misconception (not always true) that the
more secure a system is, the less accessible it is. I&#8217;d like to address that
misconception, and help you to make your applications as transparently
secure as possible.</p>

<p>The first thing we&#8217;ll take a look at are some of the objectives of
information security that are most generally applicable to software,
i.e. those that we can address. Then we&#8217;ll take a high-level walk through
some basic UNIX security that&#8217;s applicable (and perhaps on the Windows
platform as well). Even if your application is a web application, it&#8217;s
probably running on a UNIX machine of some sort, and that represents an area
that you should pay attention to as well. If you&#8217;re a Windows developer,
there will still be some information applicable, but you can probably skim
through this part. Then we&#8217;ll take a high level look at cryptography; I&#8217;ve
chosen to stay away from deep mathematical discussions and only discuss
those aspects you need to understand as a coder to effectively make use of
it. Following that, we&#8217;ll see a few scenarios where your code is
vulnerable. The rest of this chapter will be a gentle introduction to each
of those areas, and the rest of the book will flesh it out with code
examples.</p>

<p>There are four information security principles you should keep in mind when
writing software:</p>

<ol>
<li>Privacy</li>
<li>Anonymity</li>
<li>Repudiation</li>
<li>Integrity</li>
</ol>


<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at these in a little more depth, and see how they apply to the software we&#8217;re writing.</p>

<p>First, we visit the concepts of <strong>authentication</strong> and <strong>authorisation</strong>.
Authentication is confirming the identity of a user&#8211;most often by way of a
username (the user&#8217;s identity) and password (the secret used to
authenticate). Other ways of authentication include using smart cards, where
the identity is given by the cryptographic key on the card and the
authentication is done by entering a PIN to unlock the key, or perhaps using
something like a one-time password token tied to an OpenID. Once the user&#8217;s
identity has been confirmed (the user is now <strong>authenticated</strong>), their
access to resources is controlled by <strong>authorisation</strong>. Authorisation is the
check to see &#8220;is this user allowed to do this?&#8221; If we look at this from the
perspective of a user&#8217;s ability to access files on a computer, they are
typically authenticated by their login and password (or, on some laptops,
via a login and fingerprint). When a user tries to read or write to a file,
the system checks the access control list (an authorisation scheme) to see
if the user is authorised to do this. Let&#8217;s look at the Twitter application
on a mobile as another example: when you try to use the app, you have to
sign into twitter and authorise access on Twitter&#8217;s website for the
application. Your username and password authenticate you to Twitter, and
then you choose to authorise the application&#8217;s access to the site.
Authentication and authorisation may be done by other means as well for
entities other than users. We&#8217;ll call any entity a user in this book, but
that user might be a person, a computer, or something else entirely. With
that dead horse beaten, we can move on.</p>

<p>The principle of <strong>privacy</strong> states that information may only be viewed by
those authorised to view it. In terms of UNIX files, a user might be able to
log into a computer, but does not have access to read another user&#8217;s files.
On twitter, you can protect your timeline, so that only your friends can
read your tweet. It&#8217;s not unreasonable for a user to expect they can control
who else has access to their resources; obviously a user with a public blog
expects anyone to be able to read their posts, but they may not expect just
anyone to see other details about that user. When you&#8217;re designing an
application, it helps to think about which pieces of information a user
should have control over. Some applications will require fine-grained
control&#8211;say it&#8217;s designed so user A can choose to share one post only with
group B and another post only with group C. Others will be
course-grained&#8211;users in group B will always have access to posts by user A.</p>

<p><strong>Anonymity</strong> is a hot topic these days with the so-called &#8220;nym wars&#8221; on
Google+ as but one example. This boils down to the idea that, depending on
your stance, a user should be able to separate their different identities
from each other. In the Google+ debate, it&#8217;s the idea that users want to be
able to separate their real-world identity from their electronic identity.
That is, my identity on Google+ may not be the same identity I want to use
on my blog. This brings out another point about security: most security
engineering isn&#8217;t just a technical question; it&#8217;s a social question. Many of
our applications aren&#8217;t just technical applications, but have social value
as well; many security decisions are made by weighing social considerations.
Your decision in regards to anonymity is going to be a social decision, but
it should be decided while designing the application. Bolt-on security
(added after the design phase) may be somewhat effective, but it tends to
cause a lot of problems.</p>

<p><strong>Repudiation</strong> is a fancy word that means the ability to deny ownership of
information. You&#8217;ll hear this term a lot in discussions about cryptography,
particularly with digital signatures. If a user&#8217;s data is <strong>repudiable</strong>,
the user can plausibly deny owning that data (for example, user A might want
to be able to deny having posted something unpopular about a sensitive
topic). Conversely, if a user&#8217;s information is <strong>non-repudiable</strong>, she
cannot plausibly deny owning that information. I&#8217;ll have more to say on this
in a bit, but for now you know what I&#8217;m talking about when I bandy about the
term like &#8220;non-repudiable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Users also want some degree of assurance that their data won&#8217;t be changed or
tampered with. This is the principle of <strong>data integrity</strong>&#8211;information may
only be changed by people authorised to do so. This isn&#8217;t just a security
issue; natural disasters and junior sysadmins (some would say naming both is
a redundancy) have a clever way of accidentally modifying your data without
the user&#8217;s authorisation. Of course, we expect (and probably constantly
tell) users to backup their data, but your application may not be easily
backed up by the user. There&#8217;s also a case to be made for <strong>transparency</strong>
in both showing users what data you have of theirs on your systems or in
your application and allowing them to download or backup that information
easily. Even data like photos, which are easy to back up, may come from a
disparate number of sources, should be considered. For example, a user might
upload photos from his phone, his laptop, and his tablet. All these
different sources may make backing up more difficult, although far from
impossible, and having one place to back them all up from may be useful.</p>

<p>These basic principles are all properties to consider when designing your
system; they fit alongside all the other software engineering principles
like modularity that should be considered. It is far easier to design these
in at the start than to try to bolt them on later.</p>

<p>Another thing to think about is the use case for your software; namely, you
might not be able to think of all the ways users will use the system. Of
course, we&#8217;d like to think of our users as living in an ideal world where
using real names isn&#8217;t an issue and no one has anything to hide, but this is
not the world we live in. You should also consider some of the challenges
faced by users living in non-ideal places. If you&#8217;re allowing people to
upload data or users must download information to synchronise, consider that
many users don&#8217;t have high-speed internet or a large bandwidth cap. In many
countries, power is at a premium, and users shut down their computers when
they aren&#8217;t using them out of economic necessity, instead of being able to
leave them on. Users might also be living in restrictive regions where
posting information critical of other people might be dangerous for them. If
you have any desire for your software to have a global impact, you should
consider them. If your application isn&#8217;t region-specific, you should most
certainly keep this in mind when designing your software.</p>

<p>There are a couple areas you can start to actually design security into your
code. First, there are the fundamental security mechanisms available on the
platform you are coding on. There are coding errors that can lead to flaws,
such as the well-known SQL injections and buffer overflows that are some of
the mainstays of many successful attacks. There are mechanisms to secure
data in transit (when the data is being accessed and used) and at rest (when
the data is not being used). As coding errors have been dealt with quite
effectively in many other books (see the bibliography for more), we&#8217;ll focus
on the fundamental security mechanisms and other data security mechanisms,
and in particular, how we can use basic UNIX security mechanisms and
cryptography effectively. We&#8217;ll also consider some real world ways in which
failing to secure your code can lead to an exploit.</p>
