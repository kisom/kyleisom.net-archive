I am a software engineer in the United States, and I deal mostly with
C and python. This is a quick tour of my GitHub repositories. I am very 
interested in information security, data mining, and natural language 
processing (although just getting started with the latter two). Unless 
explicitly stated otherwise, all of my code is released under a dual ISC / 
public domain license, and it's up to the user which to follow.</p>
<h2>Some of the projects that I have actually finished are:</h2>
<hr />

<ul>
<li><p>
<a href="https://github.com/kisom/woofs">woofs</a>: woofs allows you to quickly offer a 
file for download on your machine. It behaves the same as 
<a href="http://www.home.unix-ag.org/simon/woof.html">the <code>woof</code> script written by Simon Budig</a> 
but providing SSL encryption. </p>
</li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://www.github.com/kisom/ctrans">ctrans</a>: the code comment translator.
This takes C-style and perl-style comments in source code and translates them.
It is based on the Google translate API, which is apparently deprecated. This 
probably doesn't work anymore...</p>
</li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://github.com/kisom/libdaemon">libdaemon</a>: libdaemon is a lightweight 
daemonisation platform that runs on OpenBSD and Linux. </p>
</li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://github.com/kisom/irssi-scripts">irssi scripts</a>: scripts for irssi. 
This includes a couple of scripts that I find useful: <code>xosd</code>, an XOSD-based
notification script and <code>geojoin</code>, a GeoIP lookup script for IRC joins.</p>
</li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://github.com/kisom/timecard">timecard</a>: a simple timecard / clocking 
program. It features project-based time tracking and a conky mode.</p>
</li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://github.com/kisom/py-rouletted">rouletted</a>: randomly kill users! This
is a python-based script that runs on a server and randomly kills logged in 
users. This is an integral part of a modern BOFH's toolkit and will instill
respect in your users.</p>
</li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://github.com/kisom/rawk">rawk</a>: rage against web frameworks - posix 
shell static site generator. I use this a lot for a couple of my sites:
<a href="http://www.kyleisom.net">my personal site</a>, 
<a href="http://coder.kyleisom.net">my coder's site</a>, 
<a href="http://kisom.devio.us">my devio.us page</a>, and last but not least,
<a href="http://rawk.brokenlcd.net">the rawk documentation site</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://github.com/kisom/APOD_py">APOD</a>: python script to pull down the APOD 
and, in OS X, GNOME, and fluxbox, set the desktop background. I've had this
running on one of my desktops since November 2010 without a glitch.  <br />  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Some documentation I've written:</h2>
<hr />
I like to write documentation so I don't have to repeat the learning process 
in the future.<ul>
<li><p>
<a href="https://github.com/kisom/crypto_intro">Intro to Cryptography With PyCrypto </a>: 
It is aimed at introducing basic cryptography topics to programmers who are 
unfamiliar with cryptography and the PyCrypto library. I ended up writing this
after the combination of having to use the library heavily for work (and 
thereby gaining a high level of proficiency with the library) and having some
friends who wanted to do some cryptography work without understanding the
basics of cryptography and what it provides.</p>
</li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://github.com/kisom/openssl_guide">Introduction to Using OpenSSL in C</a>: 
a very much <strong>unfinished</strong> project to write documentation I could use as a 
quick reference when writing SSL code in C. The project that I was working on
requiring C SSL code was nixed, and I ended up not getting anywhere with the
documentation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Some projects I'm working on that I think are interesting:</h2>
<hr />

<ul>
<li><p>
<a href="https://github.com/kisom/newsread">newsread</a>: too many sources in my news 
feeds have far too much noise and it makes getting useful information take up
more of my time than it should. That's the motivation for this project. Along
the way, I expect to learn some natural language processing, datamining, and
fun math to help filter everything out. </p>
</li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://github.com/kisom/pymods">pymods</a>: a collection of python modules I 
wrote. These include a mail module, a supervisor module (for fault-tolerance),
some NLP code, and a timer module. </p>
</li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://github.com/kisom/Login-Fuzzer">Login-Fuzzer</a>: fuzzing authentication 
code in python. The story is, I locked myself out of my guru plug while setting 
it up in a hurry. I know what password I intended to use when setting the root 
password, but apparently I typo'd it <em>twice</em>. This is my attempt at regaining 
access without having to spend $50 for a JTAG adapter.   <br />  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Contact information:</h2>
<hr />

I have a <a href="keys/coder.asc">development GnuPG key</a>:
<pre><code>pub   4096R/B7B720D6 2010-10-30 [expires: 2015-10-29]
  Key fingerprint = 9C2B BF53 FB89 50D4 554F  1708 35C8 B8B3 B7B7 20D6</code></pre>
<p>
I also have <a href="keys/kyle.asc">a PGP key</a> with current contact information:
<pre><code>pub   4096R/63AD01BF 2011-06-18 [expires: 2014-01-02]
   Key fingerprint = BDAD 4068 EF75 0A49 49CC  82A0 8705 DF24 63AD 01BF</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
Both keys are available from the <a href="http://pgp.mit.edu">MIT PGP Public Key Server</a>.</p>

(I've omitted the uid display to prevent my email addresseses from being
harvested for spam). </p>
<h2>End notes:</h2>
<hr />

The colour scheme is the <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Solarized</a> 
theme by Ethan Schoover. I also use this theme in

as in <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>.<p>
Markdown parsing is provided by <a href="http://s01.de/~tox/index.cgi/proj_smu">smu</a>,
which I find superior to every other markdown parser I've seen.</p>
