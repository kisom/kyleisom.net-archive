Imagine you are the owner of a small restaurant. The neighbourhood is of mixed 
quality, but this is where you live so you try to make do anyways. One day, 
new laws are passed such that if anyone in your restaurant conducts any sort of 
illegal activity (like a drug deal), the police blockade your restaurant and 
force everyone out. Furthermore, this new law isn't clear about how to get your 
restaurant back. The politicans who made this law have absolutely no experience 
in the restaurant industry, but still expect you to continually monitor all your 
patrons and do the work of the police and law enforcement for them. At any time, 
one of your patrons can call the police and claim something happened in your 
restaurant and you get shutdown. On top of all this, there are people actively 
looking for anything untoward happening so as to shut you down. What do you 
do? You can't really afford to hire more waiters and waitresses or security 
personnel to monitor (and don't really want to establish that kind of atmosphere 
in your business anyhow); CCTV and other technical measures have too long of a 
delay (or require you to suspect something happened so you can check the tapes). 
Really, the only thing you can do is to move out of town.

Of course I'm talking about [PIPA](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s112-968) 
and [SOPA](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-3261). The story I 
told isn't entirely [isomorphic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%2C_Escher%2C_Bach)
to the current situation, but it gets the idea across. The 
politicians enacting this legislation have admittedly no technical knowledge, despite the 
fact that the vast majority of the people working in the tech industry have decried this 
as a universally uneducated and ineffective decision that will do more to hurt the innocent 
than to accomplish its stated objectives.

This is the exact reason why I would not start a tech business in the US anymore. 
Starting a business is hard enough with everything else; worrying about the legal 
environment is too much and there are plenty of places where law enforcement does 
its job instead of placing the burden on you.

Unfortunately, just leaving the country isn't going to let me just dodge the 
effects. What happens when you lose a large part of your market share (i.e. the
US market)? [Ars Technica](http://www.arstechnica.com) has a 
[good writeup](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/01/what-does-sopa-mean-for-us-foreigners.ars)
on how SOPA/PIPA affect foreign users.

So what could the government do instead?

* work on improving the technical skills of their workforce (not driving away the people with these skills with the government's current overwhelming ineptitude would be a good start)   
* being far more transparent about the process of taking down a site

Unfortunately, I don't have enough money to pay the government to listen to me.

if you don't believe the government would possibly abuse or misuse their 
takedown powers.
