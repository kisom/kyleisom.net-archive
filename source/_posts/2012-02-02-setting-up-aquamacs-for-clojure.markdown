It took me a bit to get my [Aquamacs](http://www.aquamacs.org) install
up and ready to do [Clojure](http://www.clojure.org)
and [SLIME](http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/), so I figured I'd jot
some notes down for future me and anyone who happens to be listening.
<!-- more -->

I assume Aquamacs has been downloaded and 
[leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) is installed. First,
in a terminal, you'll need to install swank-clojure. As of today, the
current version is 1.4.0, but I strongly recommend you check the README
to see if there's a new version out. In the shell, 
`lein plugin install swank-clojure "1.4.0"`.

I use [Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/) for package management, so 
the first thing to do is to add Marmalade to Aquamacs. Open up
`"~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs\ Emacs/Preferences.el"` in your editor
of choice (I used [MacVim](https://code.google.com/p/macvim/)), and add 
the folowing:

{% codeblock lang:clojure %}
;; Marmalade
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))
(package-initialize)
{% endcodeblock %}

I'm assuming you don't have `package.el` installed yet, so make sure to
{% codeblock %}
`curl "http://repo.or.cz/w/emacs.git/blob_plain/1a0a666f941c99882093d7bd08ced15033bc3f0c:/lisp/emacs-lisp/package.el" > ~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs\ Emacs/package.el`
{% endcodeblock %}

Now fire up Aquamacs (or evaluate the additions to `Preferences.el` with
`C-x C-e`. `clojure-mode` needs to be installed, either via `M-x package-list-packages`, 
and marking `clojure-mode` for installation (with `i`) and installing
(with `x`), or with `M-x package-refresh-contents` followed by
`M-x package-install clojure-mode`. I also like `paredit` but you 
might not, it takes some getting used to.

Now, open up a file in your lein'd project and use `M-x clojure-jack-in`. 
You might see some errors pop up in your `*Compile-Log*` buffer, but you
should be very shortly greeted with a REPL.

Happy hacking!

## The End Result
Here's a screenshot of how it turned out (click to view it full-size):

I usually run aquamacs full-screen with two panes, left-side for editing
source code and right-size for SLIME.
