Noir v. Flask: the shootout

I wrote a quick REST API server as an illustration for a blog post, but
I wrote both a Python and a Clojure version. I wrote a test suite to
cover the entire API (of course - you *do* write tests too, right?),
and I figured while I was at it, I might as well benchmark the two. Here
are the results of 1,000 runs:

<!-- more -->

* noir: average run time: `0:00:00.171184` (0.171184 seconds)
* flask: average run time: `0:00:00.147073` (0.147073 seconds)

Notes:

* the time to start the noir server is much longer, about 5-10 seconds
on my 2011 Macbook Air (1.6 GHz Intel Core i5 with 4G of RAM and a 64G
SSD)
* both servers were running on the same machine at the same time,
obviously just listening on different ports
* I tested this with the Python test suite
