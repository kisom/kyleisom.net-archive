I am a software engineer in the United States, and I deal mostly with
C and python. I am fascinated by information security, data mining, and
natural language processing (although just getting started with the 
latter two). Lately, I've been rocking a lot more Clojure and getting back
to functional programming.

## Some of my writing

* [Working Introduction to Cryptography](http://kyleisom.net/blog/2011/06/17/intro-to-crypto/)
is a quick introduction to the subject, illustrated with Python. 
It is aimed at introducing basic cryptography topics to programmers who are 
unfamiliar with cryptography and the PyCrypto library. I ended up writing this
after the combination of having to use the library heavily for work (and 
thereby gaining a high level of proficiency with it) and having some
friends who wanted to do some cryptography work without understanding the
basics of cryptography and what it provides.

* [Basic Set Theory](http://kyleisom.net/blog/2012/02/01/using-set-theory/) and
[Using Set Theory](http://kyleisom.net/blog/2012/02/01/using-set-theory/): a
coder's introduction to set theory. Illustrated with Python and Clojure.

* [Suddenly Enlightenment](http://kyleisom.net/blog/2011/12/03/suddenly-enlightenment/)
describes git hooks and how to use them.

* [Coders (Should) Do Much More Than Code](http://kyleisom.net/blog/2011/09/10/coders-should-do-much-more-than-code/)
talks about some of the other skills that go into being a successful programmer.

* [My Docs Got Dropped](http://kyleisom.net/blog/2011/12/31/my-docs-got-dropped/)
is a post that made it to the front page of [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com).
While it made it there because it was New Year's weekend (and therefore a slow night),
but it happened to be posted in a timely manner (i.e. right after the Stratfor notices
went out).

## Contact information

I have a [development GnuPG key](keys/coder.asc):
{% codeblock %}
   pub   4096R/B7B720D6 2010-10-30 [expires: 2015-10-29]
     Key fingerprint = 9C2B BF53 FB89 50D4 554F  1708 35C8 B8B3 B7B7 20D6
{% endcodeblock %}

I also have [a PGP key](keys/kyle.asc) with current contact information:
{% codeblock %}
   pub   4096R/63AD01BF 2011-06-18 [expires: 2014-01-02]
      Key fingerprint = BDAD 4068 EF75 0A49 49CC  82A0 8705 DF24 63AD 01BF
{% endcodeblock %}

Both keys are available from the [MIT PGP Public Key Server](http://pgp.mit.edu).

(I've omitted the uid display to prevent my email addresseses from being
harvested for spam). 

I can also be found lurking on freenode in #devious (the channel for the
[BSD public shell server](http://www.devio.us) I help run) and #clojure.
I go by vimja, emacsdaddy, or kyle_dev. 

I can also be reached on XMPP, Skype, and iMessage; you can get those 
from one of the other contact methods.
