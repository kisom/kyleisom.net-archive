I have a site, called [tyrfingr](http://tyrfingr.errno61.net), that serves
as a portfolio of my UNIX coding projects.

## Examples of Coding Style
* [srm](./srm.c.html) is a simple C utility to remove files securely. I didn't
have a network connection when I need the capability, so I wrote my own.

## Finished Projects
* [woofs](https://github.com/kisom/woofs): woofs allows you to quickly offer a 
file for download on your machine. It behaves the same as 
[the `woof` script written by Simon Budig](http://www.home.unix-ag.org/simon/woof.html) 
but providing SSL encryption. 

* [ctrans](https://www.github.com/kisom/ctrans): the code comment translator.
This takes C-style and perl-style comments in source code and translates them.
It is based on the Google translate API, which is apparently deprecated. This 
probably doesn't work anymore...

* [libdaemon](https://github.com/kisom/libdaemon): libdaemon is a lightweight 
daemonisation platform that runs on OpenBSD and Linux. 

* [irssi scripts](https://github.com/kisom/irssi-scripts): scripts for irssi. 
This includes a couple of scripts that I find useful: `xosd`, an XOSD-based
notification script and `geojoin`, a GeoIP lookup script for IRC joins.

* [timecard](https://github.com/kisom/timecard): a simple timecard / clocking 
program. It features project-based time tracking and a conky mode.

* [rouletted](https://github.com/kisom/py-rouletted): randomly kill users! This
is a python-based script that runs on a server and randomly kills logged in 
users. This is an integral part of a modern BOFH's toolkit and will instill
respect in your users.

* [rawk](https://github.com/kisom/rawk): rage against web frameworks - posix 
shell static site generator. I use this a lot for a couple of my sites:
[my coder's site](http://coder.kyleisom.net), 
[my devio.us page](http://kisom.devio.us), and last but not least,
[the rawk documentation site](http://rawk.brokenlcd.net).

* [APOD](https://github.com/kisom/APOD_py): python script to pull down the APOD 
and, in OS X, GNOME, and fluxbox, set the desktop background. I've had this
running on one of my desktops since November 2010 without a glitch.    


## Interesting In-Progress Projects

* [newsread](https://github.com/kisom/newsread): too many sources in my news 
feeds have far too much noise and it makes getting useful information take up
more of my time than it should. That's the motivation for this project. Along
the way, I expect to learn some natural language processing, datamining, and
fun math to help filter everything out. 

* [pymods](https://github.com/kisom/pymods): a collection of python modules I 
wrote. These include a mail module, a supervisor module (for fault-tolerance),
some NLP code, and a timer module. 

* [Login-Fuzzer](https://github.com/kisom/Login-Fuzzer): fuzzing authentication 
code in python. The story is, I locked myself out of my guru plug while setting 
it up in a hurry. I know what password I intended to use when setting the root 
password, but apparently I typo'd it *twice*. This is my attempt at regaining 
access without having to spend $50 for a JTAG adapter.
