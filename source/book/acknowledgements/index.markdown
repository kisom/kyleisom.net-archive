This book almost certainly would not have been written were it not for the
Pragmatic Programmers, LLC, and their PragProWriMo
[event](http://pragprog.com/magazines/2011-10/up-front). Although Iâ€™ve had
the idea to do this for a while, the PragProWriMo was the spark that ignited
the fuel.

I'd also like to thank the people who reviewed this book: Beau and Essie
Holton, Matthew Sowers, and Clark Lester.
