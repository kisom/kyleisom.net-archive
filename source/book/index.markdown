I started trying to write a book on practical data security for developers; 
it's kind of stalled but I'd like to publish chapters here.

### Introduction to Crypto
Before I got it in my head to write a book, I wrote a short article to
explain the basics of cryptography, illustrated with Python (and 
specifically, the [PyCrypto](https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/)
library. I published the article 
[on my blog](http://kyleisom.net/blog/2011/06/17/intro-to-crypto/) and
I have a [PDF available](/downloads/crypto_intro.pdf).

### The book so far:
0. [Outline](/book/outline/)
0. [Acknowledgements](/book/acknowledgements/)
0. [Introduction](/book/introduction/)
0. [Chapter 1: Introduction to Data Security](/book/chapter1/)
0. [Chapter 2: Practical Introduction to Cryptography](/book/chapter2/)
0. [Chapter 3: Practical Threat Modeling](/book/chapter3/)
0. [Bibliography](/book/bibliography/)

I've been using [easybook](http://www.easybook-project.org) to build 'publishable'
versions of the work in progress.
